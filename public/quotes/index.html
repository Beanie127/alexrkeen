        <blockquote>The most terrifying fact about the universe is not that it is hostile but that it is indifferent;
          but
          if
          we can come to terms with this indifference and accept the challenges of life within the boundaries of
          death—however
          mutable man may be able to make them—our existence as a species can have genuine meaning and fulfilment.
          However
          vast the darkness, we must supply our own light.<cite>Stanley Kubrick</cite></blockquote>
        <blockquote>Every normal man must be tempted, at times, to spit on his hands, hoist the black flag, and begin
          slitting
          throats.<cite>H. L. Mencken</cite></blockquote>

        <blockquote>The aim of psychoanalysis is not to cure people but to show them that there is nothing wrong with
          them.<cite>Adam Philips</cite></blockquote>
        <blockquote>Creative people are especially observant, and they value accurate observation (telling themselves
          the
          truth) more than other people do. They often express part-truths, but this they do vividly; the part they
          express
          is
          the generally unrecognized; by displacement of accent and apparent disproportion in statement they seek to
          point
          to
          the usually unobserved. They see things as others do, but also as others do not.<cite>David Ogilvy</cite>
        </blockquote>
        <blockquote>If you seek tranquillity, do less. Which brings a double satisfaction: to do less,
          better.<cite>Marcus
            Aurelius</cite></blockquote>

          destiny?<cite>Jim
            Butcher</cite></blockquote>

          <h3>Litany of Tarski</h3>

        <blockquote>The creation of something new is not accomplished by the intellect but by the play instinct acting
          from
          inner necessity. The creative mind plays with the objects it loves.<cite>Carl Jung</cite></blockquote>
        <blockquote>And God, let me enjoy this. Life isn't just a sequence of waiting for things to be done.<cite>Ze

        <blockquote>Just because you're winning a game doesn't mean it's a good game.<cite>Seth Godin</cite>
        </blockquote>
        <blockquote>To try and fail is at least to learn; to fail to try is to suffer the inestimable loss of what might
          have
          been.<cite>Chester Barnard</cite></blockquote>
        <blockquote>Alas for those that never sing but die with all their music in them<cite>Oliver Wendell
            Holmes</cite>
        </blockquote>
        <blockquote>Monsters are real, ghosts are real too. They live inside us, and sometimes, they win.<cite>Stephen
            King</cite></blockquote>
        <blockquote>Being a grown-up means taking responsibility for the experiment of your life, without looking for
          some
          actual or imaginary parent to stamp it with their blessing.<cite>Joe Moran</cite></blockquote>

          possible.<cite>Richard Feynman</cite></blockquote>
        <blockquote>An intellectual is someone whose mind watches itself.<cite>Albert Camus</cite></blockquote>
        <blockquote>If we habitually extinguish boredom with technology instead of allowing the brain to enter default
          mode,
          we're essentially letting the thought processes that are supposed to help inform our individual stance towards
          society be endlessly intruded by that very society.<cite>Mariah Olson</cite></blockquote>
        <blockquote>You can fail at what you don't want, so you might as well take a shot at what you do.<cite>Jim
            Carrey</cite></blockquote>
        <blockquote>A goal without a plan is just a wish.<cite>Antoine de Saint-Exupéry</cite></blockquote>
        <blockquote>Inspiration is for amateurs; the rest of us just show up and get to work. If you wait around for the
          clouds to part and a bolt of lightning to strike you in the brain, you are not going to make an awful lot of
          work.
          All the best ideas come out of the process; they come out of the work itself.<cite>Chuck Close</cite>
        </blockquote>
        <blockquote>Often the mind needs the relaxation of inner controls—needs to be freed in reveries or day
          dreaming—for
          the unaccustomed ideas to emerge.<cite>Rollo May</cite></blockquote>
        <blockquote>Suffering turns up when there is […] too big a gap between who a person feels himself to be and who
          he
          wants to be.<cite>Adam Philips</cite></blockquote>
        <blockquote>Don't aspire to make a living, aspire to make a difference.<cite>Denzel Washington</cite>
        </blockquote>
        <blockquote>If you make a fool of yourself, you can do it with dignity, without taking your pants down. And if
          you
          do
          take your pants down, you can still do it with dignity.<cite>William Shatner</cite></blockquote>
        <blockquote>Don't become a well-rounded person. Well rounded people are smooth and dull. Become a thoroughly
          spiky
          person. Grow spikes from every angle. Stick in their throats like a pufferfish. If you want to woo the muse of
          the
          odd, don't read Shakespeare. Read Webster's revenge plays. Don't read Homer and Aristotle. Read Herodotus
          where
          he's
          off talking about Egyptian women having public sex with goats. If you want to read about myth don't read
          Joseph
          Campbell, read about convulsive religion, read about voodoo and the Millerites and the Munster Anabaptists.
          There
          are hundreds of years of extremities, there are vast legacies of mutants. There have always been geeks. There
          will
          always be geeks. Become the apotheosis of geek. Learn who your spiritual ancestors were. You didn't come here
          from
          nowhere. There are reasons why you're here. Learn those reasons. Learn about the stuff that was buried because
          it
          was too experimental or embarrassing or inexplicable.<cite>Bruce Sterling</cite></blockquote>
        <blockquote>Only those who will risk going too far can possibly find out how far one can go.<cite>T. S.
            Eliot</cite>
        </blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          <h3>Litany of Gendlin</h3>
          What is true is already so.<br>
          Owning up to it doesn't make it worse.<br>
          Not being open about it doesn't make it go away.<br>
          And because it's true, it is what is there to be interacted with.<br>
          Anything untrue isn't there to be lived.<br>
          People can stand what is true,<br>
          for they are already enduring it.<br><cite>Eliezer Yudkowsky</cite>

        <blockquote>You can't be spontaneous within reason.<cite>Alan Watts</cite></blockquote>
        <blockquote>The profoundest mind must also be the most frivolous one.<cite>Friedrich Nietzsche</cite>
        </blockquote>

          detective novel.<cite>Alan Moore</cite></blockquote>

        <blockquote>Lots of times you don't know what interests you most until you start talking.<cite>Holden Caulfield,
            'The
            Catcher in the Rye'</cite></blockquote>
        <blockquote>The hottest places in hell are reserved for those who, in a period of moral crisis, maintain their
          neutrality.<cite>John F. Kennedy</cite></blockquote>
        <blockquote>If you want to connect with an audience… you have to ignore them when you are making the work.
          Because
          if
          you're making the work for the audience, it's no longer a genuine work. It's no longer authentic. The
          authenticity
          is what makes it good. You putting yourself into it, flaws and all. Ugly and all. Beautiful and all. Weird and
          all.
          All of those things are what makes people connect. So when I say 'the audience comes last', I do mean it, but
          the
          reason the audience comes last is, the audience has to come last – in service to the audience. If you are
          making
          it
          for the audience, you will undershoot the target. If you are making it for yourself, you'll do the best
          work.<cite>Rick Rubin</cite></blockquote>
        <blockquote>Curiosity is the very basis of education and if you tell me that curiosity killed the cat, I say
          only
          the
          cat died nobly.<cite>Arnold Edinborough</cite></blockquote>
        <blockquote>We live in the world that exists. The best we can do for the world we want to live in is build
          it.<cite>Lee, 'If The Chosen One Can't Defy Heteronormative Structures, Who Can?'</cite></blockquote>
        <blockquote>A good storyteller is a good observer—everything else is just style.<cite>Chris Cleave</cite>
        </blockquote>
        <blockquote>To be great is to be misunderstood.<cite>Oscar Wilde</cite></blockquote>
        <blockquote>What we need most of all […] is a sense that we've been attended to, listened to, and worried about.
          We
          want our existence to be acknowledged and noted.<cite>Joe Moran</cite></blockquote>
        <blockquote>What makes something real is that it can't be represented to completion.<cite>Jaron Lanier</cite>
        </blockquote>
        <blockquote>Nobody tells this to people who are beginners, I wish someone told me. All of us who do creative
          work,
          we
          get into it because we have good taste. But there is this gap. For the first couple years you make stuff, it's
          just
          not that good. It's trying to be good, it has potential, but it's not. But your taste, the thing that got you
          into
          the game, is still killer. And your taste is why your work disappoints you. A lot of people never get past
          this
          phase, they quit. Most people I know who do interesting, creative work went through years of this. We know our
          work
          doesn't have this special thing we want it to have. We all go through this. And if you are just starting out
          or
          you
          are still in this phase, you gotta know it's normal and the most important thing you can do is do a lot of
          work.
          Put
          yourself on a deadline so that every week you will finish one story. It's only by going through a volume of
          work
          that you will close that gap, and your work will be as good as your ambitions. And I took longer to figure out
          how
          to do this than anyone I've ever met. It's gonna take a while. It's normal to take a while. You've just gotta
          fight
          your way through.<cite>Ira Glass</cite></blockquote>
        <blockquote>As my mother once said: The boys throw stones at the frogs in jest. But the frogs die in
          earnest.<cite>Joanna Russ</cite></blockquote>
        <blockquote>There is only one kind of shock worse than the totally unexpected: the expected for which one has
          refused
          to prepare.<cite>Mary Renault</cite></blockquote>
        <blockquote>Belonging is the innate human desire to be part of something larger than us. Because this yearning
          is
          so
          primal, we often try to acquire it by fitting in and by seeking approval, which are not only hollow
          substitutes
          to
          belonging, but often barriers to it. Because true belonging only happens when we present our authentic,
          imperfect
          selves to the world, our sense of belonging can never be greater than our level of self-acceptance.<cite>Brené
            Brown</cite></blockquote>
        <blockquote>Don't take advice from people like me who got very lucky. Taylor Swift telling you to follow your
          dreams
          is like a lottery winner saying “Liquidise your assets! Buy Powerball tickets! It works!”<cite>Bo
            Burnham</cite>
        </blockquote>
        <blockquote>The truth does not change according to our ability to stomach it.<cite>Flannery O'Connor</cite>
        </blockquote>
        <blockquote>Practice any art […] no matter how well or badly, not to get money and fame, but to experience
          becoming,
          to find out what's inside you, to make your soul grow.<cite>Kurt Vonnegut</cite></blockquote>
        <blockquote>The only person you are destined to become is the person you decide to be.<cite>Ralph Waldo
            Emerson</cite>
        </blockquote>
        <blockquote>As our island of knowledge grows, so does the shore of our ignorance.<cite>John Whacker</cite>
        </blockquote>
        <blockquote>We are what we pretend to be, so we must be careful about what we pretend to be.<cite>Kurt
            Vonnegut</cite>
        </blockquote>
        <blockquote>The creative process requires more than reason […] I am almost incapable of logical thought, but I
          have
          developed techniques for keeping open the telephone line to my unconscious, in case that disorderly repository
          has
          anything to tell me.<cite>David Ogilvy</cite></blockquote>
        <blockquote>Collecting the dots. Then connecting them. And then sharing the connections with those around you.
          This
          is
          how a creative human works.<cite>Amanda Palmer</cite></blockquote>
        <blockquote>…it struck me what quality went to form a Man of Achievement, especially in Literature, and which
          Shakespeare possessed so enormously—I mean Negative Capability, that is, when a man is capable of being in
          uncertainties, mysteries, doubts, without any irritable reaching after fact and reason… with a great poet the
          sense
          of Beauty overcomes every other consideration, or rather obliterates all consideration.<cite>John Keats</cite>
        </blockquote>
        <blockquote>None of us really has the ability to understand our path until it's over.<cite>Milton Glaser</cite>
        </blockquote>
        <blockquote>The ethical progress of society depends, not on imitating the cosmic process, still less on running
          away
          from it, but on combating it.<cite>T. H. Huxley</cite></blockquote>
        <blockquote>Peace of mind is an inside job.<cite>Anne Lamott</cite></blockquote>
        <blockquote>Too often, convinced of our own intelligence or success, we stay in a comfort zone that ensures that
          we
          never feel stupid (and we are never challenged to learn or reconsider what we know). It obscures from view
          various
          weaknesses in our understanding, until eventually it's too late to change course. This is where the silent
          toll
          is
          taken.<cite>Ryan Holliday</cite></blockquote>
        <blockquote>Those who do not read books have no advantage over those who cannot read
          books.<cite>Anonymous</cite>
        </blockquote>
        <blockquote>Don't ask yourself what the world needs, ask yourself what makes you come alive, and then go and do
          that.
          Because what the world needs is people who have come alive.<cite>Howard Thurman</cite></blockquote>
        <blockquote>By doing your thing—as opposed to what you think you ought to be doing—you kindle a fire that helps
          keep
          the rest of us warm.<cite>Oliver Burkeman</cite></blockquote>
        <blockquote>We don't forgive people because they deserve it. We forgive them because they need it — because we

          it.<cite>Bree Despain</cite></blockquote>
        <blockquote>It is by going down into the abyss that we recover the treasures of life. Where you stumble, there
          lies
          your treasure.<cite>Joseph Campbell</cite></blockquote>
        <blockquote>Worthy work carries with it the hope of pleasure in rest, the hope of the pleasure in our using what
          it
          makes, and the hope of pleasure in our daily creative skill. All other work but this is worthless; it is
          slaves'
          work — mere toiling to live, that we may live to toil.<cite>William Morris</cite></blockquote>
        <blockquote>In individuals, insanity is rare; but in groups, parties, nations and epochs, it is the
          rule.<cite>Friedrich Nietzsche</cite></blockquote>
        <blockquote>Experience is what you get when you don't get what you wanted.<cite>Thaddeus Howse</cite>
        </blockquote>
        <blockquote>Albert Camus, a great humanist and existentialist voice, pointed out that to commit to a just cause
          with
          no hope of success is absurd. But then he also noted that not committing to a just cause is equally absurd.
          But
          only
          one choice offers the possibility for dignity. And dignity matters.<cite>David Simon</cite></blockquote>
        <blockquote>And lost be the day to us in which a measure hath not been danced. And false be every truth which
          hath
          not
          had laughter along with it!<cite>Friedrich Nietzsche</cite></blockquote>
        <blockquote>It is the paradox of human existence that man must simultaneously seek for closeness and for
          independence;
          for oneness with others and at the same time for the preservation of his uniqueness and particularity… the
          answer
          to
          this paradox—and to the moral problems of man—is productiveness.<cite>Erich Fromm</cite></blockquote>
        <blockquote>We are never definitely right, we can only be sure we are wrong.<cite>Richard Feynman</cite>
        </blockquote>
        <blockquote>Nature demands inequality, hierarchy, subordination of the inferior to the superior—but human
          history

          or
          reciprocate.<cite>Paul Eldridge</cite></blockquote>
        <blockquote>Every valuable human being must be a radical and a rebel, for what he must aim at is to make things

          than they are.<cite>Niels Bohr</cite></blockquote>

            Picard, 'Star Trek: The Next Generation'</cite></blockquote>
        <blockquote>Stand at the brink of the abyss of despair, and when you see that you cannot bear it anymore, draw
          back
          a
          little and have a cup of tea.<cite>Elder Sophrony of Essex</cite></blockquote>
        <blockquote>To write something, you have to risk making a fool of yourself.<cite>Anne Rice</cite></blockquote>
        <blockquote>If the muse comes to your bedside, don't tell her you'll fuck her later.<cite>Allen Ginsberg</cite>
        </blockquote>
        <blockquote>He who has a why to live can bear almost any how.<cite>Friedrich Nietzsche</cite></blockquote>
        <blockquote>The declared meaning of a spoken word is only its overcoat, and the real meaning lies underneath its
          scarves and buttons.<cite>Peter Carey</cite></blockquote>
        <blockquote>A map of the world that does not include Utopia is not worth even glancing at, for it leaves out the
          one
          country at which Humanity is always landing. And when Humanity lands there, it looks out, and, seeing a better
          country, sets sail. Progress is the realisation of Utopias.<cite>Oscar Wilde</cite></blockquote>
        <blockquote>Moral indignation is jealousy with a halo.<cite>H. G. Wells</cite></blockquote>
        <blockquote>The most dangerous thought you can have as a creative person is to think you know what you're
          doing.<cite>Bret Victor</cite></blockquote>
        <blockquote>Meaning is not something you stumble across, like the answer to a riddle or the prize in a treasure
          hunt.
          Meaning is something you build into your life. You build it out of your own past, out of your affections and
          loyalties, out of the experience of humankind as it is passed onto you, out of your own talent and
          understanding,
          out of the things you believe in, out of the things and people you love, out of the values for which you are
          willing
          to sacrifice something. The ingredients are there. You are the only one who can put them together in that
          unique
          pattern that will be your life. Let it be a life that has dignity and meaning for you. If it does, then the
          particular balance of success or failure is of less account.<cite>John William Gardner</cite></blockquote>
        <blockquote>Writing doesn't actually take that long. It's the long stretches of procrastinating that take up
          most
          of
          your time.<cite>Mark Pilgrim</cite></blockquote>
        <blockquote>The merit of originality is not novelty, it is sincerity.<cite>Thomas Carlyle</cite></blockquote>
        <blockquote>Requiring one medium to imitate the other inevitably pits strengths of the old medium against
          weaknesses
          of the new.<cite>Jim Hollan &amp; Scott Stornetta</cite></blockquote>
        <blockquote>We who lived in concentration camps can remember the men who walked through the huts comforting
          others,
          giving away their last piece of bread. They may be few in number but they offer sufficient proof that
          everything
          can
          be taken from a man but one thing: the last of the human freedoms—to choose one's attitude in any given set of
          circumstances, to choose one's own way.<cite>Victor Frankl</cite></blockquote>
        <blockquote>Much of what we call 'luck' is the macro result of 1,000s of micro actions. Your habits put you in a
          position where luck is more likely to strike. The Luck Razor: When choosing between two paths, choose the path
          that
          has a larger luck surface area.<cite>Sahil Bloom</cite></blockquote>
        <blockquote>We hate poetry that has a palpable design upon us—and if we do not agree, seems to put its hand in
          its
          breeches pocket. Poetry should be great &amp; unobtrusive, a thing which enters into one's soul, and does not
          startle it or amaze it with itself but with its subject.<cite>John Keats</cite></blockquote>
        <blockquote>Plot is a literary convention. Story is a force of nature.<cite>Teresa Nielsen Hayden</cite>
        </blockquote>
        <blockquote>All good ideas start out as bad ones, that's why it takes so long<cite>Stephen Spielberg</cite>
        </blockquote>
        <blockquote>It's not where you take things from—it's where you take them to.<cite>Jean-Luc Godard</cite>
        </blockquote>
        <blockquote>Be ashamed to die until you have won some victory for humanity.<cite>Horace Mann</cite></blockquote>
        <blockquote>Destiny is not a matter of chance; it's a matter of choice. It is not a thing to be waited for, it's
          a
          thing to be achieved.<cite>William Jennings Bryan</cite></blockquote>
        <blockquote>A man is likely to mind his own business when it is worth minding. When it is not, he takes his mind
          off
          his own meaningless affairs by minding other people's business.<cite>Eric Hoffer</cite></blockquote>
        <blockquote>You stink. Prove it. It will go faster. And then, after you write something incredibly shitty in
          about
          six
          hours, it's no problem making it better in passes, because in addition to being absolutely untalented, you are
          also
          a mean, petty CRITIC. You know how you suck and you know how everything sucks and when you see something that
          sucks,
          you know exactly how to fix it, because you're an asshole… Switch from team 'I will one day write something
          good'
          to
          team 'I have no choice but to write a piece of shit' and then take off your 'bad writer' hat and replace it
          with
          a
          'petty critic' hat and go to town on that poor hack's draft and that's your second draft.<cite>Dan
            Harmon</cite>
        </blockquote>
        <blockquote>Just start taking what you do less seriously. Consider it your job to do it wrong, embrace the idea
          that
          what you are gonna do is going to suck — just make something bad and then criticise it until it's
          good.<cite>Dan
            Harmon</cite></blockquote>
