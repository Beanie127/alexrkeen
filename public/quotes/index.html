                <blockquote>[A]s I write I think about all sorts of things. I don't necessarily write down what I'm
                    thinking; It's just that as I write I think about things. As I write, I arrange my thoughts. And
                    rewriting and revising takes my thinking down even deeper paths. No matter how much I write, though,
                    I never reach a conclusion. And no matter how much I rewrite, I never reach the destination. Even
                    after decades of writing, the same still holds true.<cite>Haruki Murakami</cite></blockquote>
                <blockquote>It is by going down into the abyss that we recover the treasures of life. Where you stumble,
                    there lies your treasure.<cite>Joseph Campbell</cite></blockquote>
                <blockquote>To try and fail is at least to learn; to fail to try is to suffer the inestimable loss of
                    what might have been.<cite>Chester Barnard</cite></blockquote>
                <blockquote>The ethical progress of society depends, not on imitating the cosmic process, still less on
                    running away from it, but on combating it.<cite>T. H. Huxley</cite></blockquote>
                <blockquote>We are what we pretend to be, so we must be careful about what we pretend to be.<cite>Kurt
                        Vonnegut</cite></blockquote>
                <blockquote>If we habitually extinguish boredom with technology instead of allowing the brain to enter
                    default mode, we're essentially letting the thought processes that are supposed to help inform our
                    individual stance towards society be endlessly intruded by that very society.<cite>Mariah
                        Olson</cite></blockquote>
                <blockquote>The creative process requires more than reason […] I am almost incapable of logical thought,
                    but I have developed techniques for keeping open the telephone line to my unconscious, in case that
                    disorderly repository has anything to tell me.<cite>David Ogilvy</cite></blockquote>
                <blockquote>Being okay with being okay is a necessary step toward great.<cite>Josh Spector</cite>
                </blockquote>
                <blockquote>A child free from the guilt of ownership and the burden of economic competition will grow up
                    with the will to do what needs doing and the capacity for joy in doing it. It is useless work that
                    darkens the heart. The delight of the nursing mother, of the scholar, of the successful hunter, of
                    the good cook, of the skilful maker, of anyone doing needed work and doing it well — this durable
                    joy is perhaps the deepest source of human affection and of sociality as a whole.<cite>Ursula K. Le
                        Guin</cite></blockquote>
                <blockquote>As our island of knowledge grows, so does the shore of our ignorance.<cite>John
                        Whacker</cite> </blockquote>
                <blockquote>Belonging is the innate human desire to be part of something larger than us. Because this
                    yearning is so primal, we often try to acquire it by fitting in and by seeking approval, which are
                    not only hollow substitutes to belonging, but often barriers to it. Because true belonging only
                    happens when we present our authentic, imperfect selves to the world, our sense of belonging can
                    never be greater than our level of self-acceptance.<cite>Brené Brown</cite></blockquote>
                <blockquote>Plot is a literary convention. Story is a force of nature.<cite>Teresa Nielsen Hayden</cite>
                </blockquote>

                <blockquote>Every normal man must be tempted, at times, to spit on his hands, hoist the black flag, and
                    begin slitting throats.<cite>H. L. Mencken</cite></blockquote>
                <blockquote>If you want to connect with an audience… you have to ignore them when you are making the
                    work. Because if you're making the work for the audience, it's no longer a genuine work. It's no
                    longer authentic. The authenticity is what makes it good. You putting yourself into it, flaws and
                    all. Ugly and all. Beautiful and all. Weird and all. All of those things are what makes people
                    connect. So when I say 'the audience comes last', I do mean it, but the reason the audience comes
                    last is, the audience has to come last – in service to the audience. If you are making it for the
                    audience, you will undershoot the target. If you are making it for yourself, you'll do the best
                    work.<cite>Rick Rubin</cite></blockquote>
                <blockquote>Writing doesn't actually take that long. It's the long stretches of procrastinating that
                    take up most of your time.<cite>Mark Pilgrim</cite></blockquote>
                <blockquote>Being a grown-up means taking responsibility for the experiment of your life, without
                    looking for some actual or imaginary parent to stamp it with their blessing.<cite>Joe Moran</cite>
                </blockquote>
                <blockquote>Pithy sentences are like sharp nails which force truth upon our memory.<cite>Denis
                        Diderot</cite> </blockquote>
                <blockquote>A map of the world that does not include Utopia is not worth even glancing at, for it leaves
                    out the one country at which Humanity is always landing. And when Humanity lands there, it looks
                    out, and, seeing a better country, sets sail. Progress is the realisation of Utopias.<cite>Oscar
                        Wilde</cite></blockquote>
                <blockquote>If you seek tranquillity, do less. Which brings a double satisfaction: to do less,
                    better.<cite>Marcus Aurelius</cite></blockquote>
                <blockquote>How do I know what I think until I see what I say?<cite>E. M. Forster</cite></blockquote>
                <blockquote>Inspiration is for amateurs; the rest of us just show up and get to work. If you wait around
                    for the clouds to part and a bolt of lightning to strike you in the brain, you are not going to make
                    an awful lot of work. All the best ideas come out of the process; they come out of the work
                    itself.<cite>Chuck Close</cite> </blockquote>
                <blockquote>For we each of us deserve everything, every luxury that was ever piled in the tombs of the
                    dead kings, and we each of us deserve nothing, not a mouthful of bread in hunger. Have we not eaten
                    while another starved? Will you punish us for that? Will you reward us for the virtue of starving
                    while others ate? No man earns punishment, no man earns reward. Free your mind of the idea of
                    deserving, the idea of earning, and you will begin to be able to think.<cite>Ursula K. Le
                        Guin</cite></blockquote>
                <blockquote>Nobody tells this to people who are beginners, I wish someone told me. All of us who do
                    creative work, we get into it because we have good taste. But there is this gap. For the first
                    couple years you make stuff, it's just not that good. It's trying to be good, it has potential, but
                    it's not. But your taste, the thing that got you into the game, is still killer. And your taste is
                    why your work disappoints you. A lot of people never get past this phase, they quit. Most people I
                    know who do interesting, creative work went through years of this. We know our work doesn't have
                    this special thing we want it to have. We all go through this. And if you are just starting out or
                    you are still in this phase, you gotta know it's normal and the most important thing you can do is
                    do a lot of work. Put yourself on a deadline so that every week you will finish one story. It's only
                    by going through a volume of work that you will close that gap, and your work will be as good as
                    your ambitions. And I took longer to figure out how to do this than anyone I've ever met. It's gonna
                    take a while. It's normal to take a while. You've just gotta fight your way through.<cite>Ira
                        Glass</cite></blockquote>
                <blockquote>We hate poetry that has a palpable design upon us—and if we do not agree, seems to put its
                    hand in its breeches pocket. Poetry should be great &amp; unobtrusive, a thing which enters into
                    one's soul, and does not startle it or amaze it with itself but with its subject.<cite>John
                        Keats</cite></blockquote>
                <blockquote>Don't aspire to make a living, aspire to make a difference.<cite>Denzel Washington</cite>

                <blockquote>By doing your thing—as opposed to what you think you ought to be doing—you kindle a fire
                    that helps keep the rest of us warm.<cite>Oliver Burkeman</cite></blockquote>
                <blockquote>…it struck me what quality went to form a Man of Achievement, especially in Literature, and
                    which Shakespeare possessed so enormously—I mean Negative Capability, that is, when a man is capable
                    of being in uncertainties, mysteries, doubts, without any irritable reaching after fact and reason…
                    with a great poet the sense of Beauty overcomes every other consideration, or rather obliterates all
                    consideration.<cite>John Keats</cite></blockquote>
                <blockquote>We live in the world that exists. The best we can do for the world we want to live in is
                    build it.<cite>Lee, 'If The Chosen One Can't Defy Heteronormative Structures, Who Can?'</cite>

                <blockquote>Better to write for yourself and have no public, than to write for the public and have no

                <blockquote>Experience is what you get when you don't get what you wanted.<cite>Thaddeus Howse</cite>
                </blockquote>
                <blockquote>One of the saddest pieces of advice in the world is "Oh come now — be realistic." The best
                    parts of this world were not fashioned by those who were "realistic."<cite>Richard N. Bolles</cite>
                </blockquote>
                <blockquote>The opposite of addiction isn't sobriety, it's purpose.<cite>Jimmy Carr</cite></blockquote>
                <blockquote>A man who procrastinates in his choosing will inevitably have his choice made for him by
                    circumstance.<cite>Hunter S. Thompson</cite></blockquote>
                <blockquote>Just start taking what you do less seriously. Consider it your job to do it wrong, embrace
                    the idea that what you are gonna do is going to suck — just make something bad and then criticise it
                    until it's good.<cite>Dan Harmon</cite></blockquote>
                <blockquote>Nature demands inequality, hierarchy, subordination of the inferior to the superior—but
                    human history [is] a series of revolts against this natural order, leading to ever greater
                    egalitarianism.<cite>Norman Cohn</cite></blockquote>

                <blockquote>Don't become a well-rounded person. Well rounded people are smooth and dull. Become a
                    thoroughly spiky person. Grow spikes from every angle. Stick in their throats like a pufferfish. If
                    you want to woo the muse of the odd, don't read Shakespeare. Read Webster's revenge plays. Don't
                    read Homer and Aristotle. Read Herodotus where he's off talking about Egyptian women having public

                    religion, read about voodoo and the Millerites and the Munster Anabaptists. There are hundreds of
                    years of extremities, there are vast legacies of mutants. There have always been geeks. There will
                    always be geeks. Become the apotheosis of geek. Learn who your spiritual ancestors were. You didn't
