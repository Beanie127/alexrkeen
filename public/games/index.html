			<h3>RADS</h3>
			<p>
				WIP. A sci-fi thriller game set in 1979, where you play as
				supernaturally powered members of a secretive resistance
				organisation called the Free Radicals, fighting radioactive
				‘demons’ and the militaristic government agencies who create
				and control them.

			<h3>Resolve</h3>
			<p>
				Part roleplaying game, part reflective practice, part Tarot
				spread. Designed for play on the 31st of December, it
				explores the idea of New Year’s resolutions and how the
				challenges we face change us over time.

			<h3>The Car Engine</h3>
			<div>
				<p>
					A lightweight system for solo or duo roleplaying while
					driving which uses car license plates to resolve
					actions.
				</p>
				<p>
					Implemented in
					<a href="https://alexrkeen.itch.io/captains-log">Captain's Log</a>, a prisoner's dilemma about retaining your
					humanity in
					deep space, and
					<a href="https://alexrkeen.itch.io/turn-signals">Turn Signals</a>, a chance encounter roleplay in homage to
					<em>Before Sunrise</em>.

			<h3>Until the bloodlust wins</h3>
			<p>
				A lyric solo journaling game about being a vampire and
				fighting the urge to drink blood. Developed from the same
				basis as <em>Resolve</em> for the RPG Creation Discord Jam.

			<h3>Gods, Glory & Gold!</h3>
			<div>
				<p>
					In a world plagued by forces of
					<strong>darkness</strong>, where survival is uncertain,
					risk your life exploring long-abandoned ruins in search
					of legendary treasures.
				</p>
				<p>
					This is my take on a "fantasy heartbreaker", an
					OSR/NSR-style dungeon-crawling TTRPG on two double-sides
					of A4.
				</p>
				<p>
					It has four iconic classes with thoughtful defining
					abilities, three flavourful cultures, a deadly simple
					resolution mechanic and more support for running the
					game than you'll ever get from D&D5e.
