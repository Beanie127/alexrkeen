      <h2>Late cancellation</h2>

        Should you need to cancel part or all of your weekend, sadly we will not
        be able to refund all of your money within 14 days of the event as per
        our contract with the hotel. Please try to find someone who can take
        your place instead. We do recommend you take out insurance against
        cancellation due to illness or check your annual policy and excess. We
        will provide you with an invoice for cancellation should you be able to
        claim.
