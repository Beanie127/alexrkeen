        <p>
          Welcome to the BIP&apos;s Autumn Gathering 2023! Thank you for joining
          us once again (or possibly for the first time) for another fantastic
          weekend of community, learning, and — of course — improv.
        </p>
        <h3>Workshop choices</h3>
        <p>
          Once again, I&apos;m delighted to be able to offer such a varied
          workshop programme, with some new teachers joining the stalwarts. This
          should help to keep our programme fresh, and present new perspectives
          on this art-form we all love so much.
        </p>
        <p>
          Having raised our attendee-cap to 90, this means we&apos;re offering
          six different workshop options throughout the weekend, so there&apos;s
          plenty to choose from.
        </p>
        <h3>Jams</h3>
        <p>
          Once again, our jams will be 90-minute sessions during the workshop
          programme. Each led/MC&apos;d by experienced improvisers, we hope
          they&apos;ll give people a chance to perform on a smaller scale,
          offering more stage time per person with less pressure to do the
          perfect scene in your one opportunity on stage.
        </p>
        <p>
          Hopefully these will give everyone a chance to show off what they can
          do, in a supportive, positive atmosphere.
        </p>
        <h3>Evening Entertainment</h3>
        <p>
          As always, there will be evening entertainment on Friday and Saturday!
          Our list of attendees happens to include some of the UK&apos;s best
          improvisers, and we&apos;ve asked them to show us their wares for an
          evening.
        </p>
        <p>
          One of our acts will be <em>The Teachers</em>! We&apos;ll be asking
          them to perform together, show off their skills, and provide your
          entertainment for the Friday evening, giving you a flavour of what you
          might expect from their workshops.
        </p>
        <p>
          We&apos;ll also be featuring performances from
          <em>Joined at the Quip</em>, <em>Canny Funny</em>,
          <em>Stephen Longstaffe</em>, <em>Barnish &amp; Carmichael</em>,
          <em>Improv On Demand</em>, <em>SomerSand</em> and the
          <em>Battle of the Superteams</em>, featuring players from
          <em>St&uuml;rike!</em>, <em>Young + Butcher</em>,
          <em>Leamprov</em> and <em>Just Ad Hoc</em>.
        </p>
        <p>
          For those in the audience, please look to be supportive and welcoming
          of the performers — this may involve a slight moderation of your
          drinking, at least until after the show (i.e. please don&apos;t think
          “I&apos;m not performing tonight, so I&apos;m just going to get
          hammered and shout things out”). I don&apos;t expect this to be a big
          problem as everyone&apos;s very nice, but I&apos;d just ask that you
          treat the performers on stage as you would want to be treated!
        </p>
