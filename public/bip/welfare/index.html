      <h1>Welfare &amp; Wellbeing</h1>
      <em>by Alex Keen</em>
      <p>
        Hi, we&apos;re Alex, Bobby, Carly, Jen &amp; Jo and we are your Welfare
        team for this BIP weekend. We&apos;re here for you to talk to if you
        have any concerns or issues with anything at BIP, or if you just fancy a
        chat. Come and find us at any point over the weekend — we&apos;ll be the
        ones wearing pink BIP shirts.
      </p>
      <h2>Incident reporting</h2>
      <p>
        To report an urgent incident, please find one of us, Geoff or Tom. If
        you cannot find a person,
        <a href="tel:+447517723666">call Alex on 0751 772 3666</a>. For
        non-urgent incidents or complaints, please use the form below. When you
        report an incident, there is no required information and we will respect
        any requests for privacy. However, the more information we have to act
        on and potentially relay to others where necessary, the better we will
        be equipped to solve any immediate or ongoing problems and make things
        better in the future.
      </p>

      <h2>Code of conduct and behaviour at the venue</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          The BIP code of conduct is
          <a href="http://britishimprovproject.com/code-of-conduct"
            >available on our website</a
          >
          and has been emailed to you.
        </li>
        <li>
          The venue sells drinks. Do not consume your own in public areas such
          as the lobby, be discreet.
        </li>
        <li>
          Do not leave cans, bottles and glasses in the function rooms after a
          show, please clean up your own drink empties, snacks etc and take
          venue glasses back to the bar.
        </li>
        <li>
          Please address any event concerns to the reception immediately if
          there is a problem with your room or to a food and beverage manager if
          you have a concern about the food. Also make Geoff aware and
          we&apos;ll try to resolve the issue. It will be too late after the
          event!
        </li>
        <li>
          Let us all maintain an environment in which people are treated with
          dignity, decency and respect. Our welfare team is made up of
          volunteers who have all attended most of the BIP events since 2015.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Trigger warning: noise</h2>
      <p>
        At various points over the weekend, 90 improvisers will be in one room
        together — this can get very noisy. Please be aware of this if you have
        sound sensitivities, especially during warm up/get to know you games, or
        the evening entertainment.
      </p>
      <h2>Your event, your feedback</h2>
      <p>
        Since 2021, we&apos;ve shared a feedback form after each event to
        understand where the event shines and where we can make improvements.
        The overall tone of feedback has been consistently positive (every year,
        95% or more say they would come back again, which says it all), but has
        also highlighted areas ripe for improvement. Here are a few of the
        changes we&amp;ve made since the last event with your help:
      </p>
      <h3>Jams and evening shows</h3>
      <p>
        Feedback on the evening entertainment model remains hugely positive, but
        two common threads emerged from the feedback. Some people felt they were
        unable to jam because there were just too many not-to-miss workshops
        (good problems to have!), while others felt they would like more
        opportunities to perform. To address this, we&apos;ve tagged out
        <em>Just a Minute</em> for an optional jam during the Saturday afternoon
        break, for those who just can&apos;t get enough. Meanwhile, we invited
        you all to submit a pitch for the evening performance, and we&apos;ve
        managed to programme every group that applied!
      </p>
      <h3>Workshop choices</h3>
      <p>
        Your input also has a big influence on how Tom selects workshops. By
        popular request, this weekend features workshops on compering/hosting,
        game of the scene and various techniques to improve acting. We&apos;ve
        also added more Level 1 workshops to the first half of the weekend so
        newer improvisers have a smoother introduction to the event and the
        artform.
      </p>
      <p>
        This is your event, so thanks for sharing your feedback and look out for
        the form once you&apos;re safely back home!
      </p>
