	<main class="col-center">
		<p>
			<strong>By profession</strong> I'm a marketing strategist, copywriter,
			frontend web developer, graphic designer and video editor. I practice
			those skills at <a href="https://www.ferrio.com">Ferrio</a>, a
			specialist software integration & automation company.
		</p>
		<p>
			<strong>Outside of working hours</strong> I do a lot of improv comedy
			— I’ve created and toured multiple award-winning shows, organised local
			and national improv events and taught the artform. I also play, run and
			design tabletop roleplaying games, read a lot and write a little.
		</p>
		<p>
			<strong>I live</strong> in Sheffield, England with my husband, who <a
				href="https://www.loxleywoodcraft.com/">
				makes beautiful things from wood
			</a>. I have no pets or children, thank you.
		</p>
		<p>
			<strong>I don’t</strong> like social media. If you want to get in touch
			with me, <a

				just send me an email
