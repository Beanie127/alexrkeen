        <p><strong>Hi, I&#39;m Alex.</strong></p>
        <p>
            <strong>I’m a nerd about</strong> stories, design, philosophy, psychology,
            creativity and play.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Professionally, I'm a</strong> marketing strategist, copywriter,
            frontend web developer, graphic designer and video editor. I practice
            those skills at <a href="https://www.ferrio.com">Ferrio</a>, a
            specialist software integration & automation company.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Outside of working hours</strong> I do a lot of improv comedy
            — I’ve created and toured multiple award-winning shows, organised local
            and national improv events and taught the artform. I also play, run and
            design tabletop roleplaying games, read a lot and write a little.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>I live</strong> in Sheffield, England with my husband, who <a
                href="https://www.loxleywoodcraft.com/"
                >makes beautiful things from wood</a
            >. I have no pets or children, thank you.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>I don’t</strong> like social media. If you want to get in touch
            with me, <a
                href="mailto:anti-spam-measure-delete-me/alexrkeen@gmx.com?subject=EDIT EMAIL ADDRESS AND SUBJECT LINE"
