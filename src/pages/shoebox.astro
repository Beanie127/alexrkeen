			This is the home of my digital miscellanea: toys, tools, tiny
			utilities and other odds and ends that are never quite finished and
			don't fit elsewhere.

			Everything here should be treated as work in progress. If it's not
			just straight-up broken, assume everything is poorly documented,
			inaccessible, riddled with bugs.
