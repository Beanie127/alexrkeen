  '<blockquote>Plot is a literary convention. Story is a force of nature.</blockquote><cite>Teresa Nielsen Hayden</cite>',
  '<blockquote>The creation of something new is not accomplished by the intellect but by the play instinct acting from inner necessity. The creative mind plays with the objects it loves.</blockquote><cite>Carl Jung</cite>',

  '<blockquote>The creative process requires more than reason […] I am almost incapable of logical thought, but I have developed techniques for keeping open the telephone line to my unconscious, in case that disorderly repository has anything to tell me.</blockquote><cite>David Ogilvy</cite>',
  '<blockquote>We hate poetry that has a palpable design upon us—and if we do not agree, seems to put its hand in its breeches pocket. Poetry should be great & unobtrusive, a thing which enters into one’s soul, and does not startle it or amaze it with itself but with its subject.</blockquote><cite>John Keats</cite>',
  '<blockquote>The merit of originality is not novelty, it is sincerity.</blockquote><cite>Thomas Carlyle</cite>',

  '<blockquote>You stink. Prove it. It will go faster. And then, after you write something incredibly shitty in about six hours, it\'s no problem making it better in passes, because in addition to being absolutely untalented, you are also a mean, petty CRITIC. You know how you suck and you know how everything sucks and when you see something that sucks, you know exactly how to fix it, because you\'re an asshole… Switch from team \'I will one day write something good\' to team \'I have no choice but to write a piece of shit\' and then take off your \'bad writer\' hat and replace it with a \'petty critic\' hat and go to town on that poor hack\'s draft and that\'s your second draft.</blockquote><cite>Dan Harmon</cite>',
  '<blockquote>You sitting at a keyboard typing… you\'re not doing anything… just start taking what you do less seriously… if you simply shit it out and consider it your job to do it wrong… embrace the idea that what you are gonna do is going to suck… just make something bad and then criticise it until it\'s good.</blockquote><cite>Dan Harmon</cite>',
  '<blockquote>Nobody tells this to people who are beginners, I wish someone told me. All of us who do creative work, we get into it because we have good taste. But there is this gap. For the first couple years you make stuff, it\'s just not that good. It\'s trying to be good, it has potential, but it\'s not. But your taste, the thing that got you into the game, is still killer. And your taste is why your work disappoints you. A lot of people never get past this phase, they quit. Most people I know who do interesting, creative work went through years of this. We know our work doesn\'t have this special thing we want it to have. We all go through this. And if you are just starting out or you are still in this phase, you gotta know it\'s normal and the most important thing you can do is do a lot of work. Put yourself on a deadline so that every week you will finish one story. It\'s only by going through a volume of work thast you will close that gap,  and your work will be as good as your ambitions. And I took longer to figure out how to do this than anyone I\'ve ever met. It\'s gonna take a while. It\'s normal to take a while. You\'ve just gotta fight your way through.</blockquote><cite>Ira Glass</cite>',

  '<blockquote>We are what we pretend to be, so we must be careful about what we pretend to be.</blockquote><cite>Kurt Vonnegut</cite>',
  '<blockquote>Monsters are real, ghosts are real too. They live inside us, and sometimes, they win.</blockquote><cite>Stephen King</cite>',

  '<blockquote>Be ashamed to die until you have won some victory for humanity.</blockquote><cite>Horace Mann</cite>',
  '<blockquote>We who lived in concentration camps can remember the men who walked through the huts comforting others, giving away their last piece of bread. They may be few in number but they offer sufficient proof that everything can be taken from a man but one thing: the last of the human freedoms—to choose one\'s attitude in any given set of circumstances, to choose one\'s own way.</blockquote><cite>Victor Frankl</cite>',

    '<blockquote>Meaning is not something you stumble across, like the answer to a riddle or the prize in a treasure hunt. Meaning is something you build into your life. You build it out of your own past, out of your affections and loyalties, out of the experience of humankind as it is passed onto you, out of your own talent and understanding, out of the things you believe in, out of the things and people you love, out of the values for which you are willing to sacrifice something. The ingredients are there. You are the only one who can put them together in that unique pattern that will be your life. Let it be a life that has dignity and meaning for you. If it does, then the particular balance of success or failure is of less account.</blockquote><cite>John William Gardner</cite>',

    '<blockquote>None of us has really the ability to understand our path until it’s over.</blockquote><cite>Milton Glaser</cite>',
    '<blockquote>Albert Camus, a great humanist and existentialist voice, pointed out that to commit to a just cause with no hope of success is absurd. But then he also noted that not committing to a just cause is equally absurd. But only one choice offers the possibility for dignity. And dignity matters.</blockquote><cite>David Simon</cite>',
    '<blockquote>Don’t become a well-rounded person. Well rounded people are smooth and dull. Become a thoroughly spiky person. Grow spikes from every angle. Stick in their throats like a pufferfish. If you want to woo the muse of the odd, don’t read Shakespeare. Read Webster’s revenge plays. Don’t read Homer and Aristotle. Read Herodotus where he’s off talking about Egyptian women having public sex with goats. If you want to read about myth don’t read Joseph Campbell, read about convulsive religion, read about voodoo and the Millerites and the Munster Anabaptists. There are hundreds of years of extremities, there are vast legacies of mutants. There have always been geeks. There will always be geeks. Become the apotheosis of geek. Learn who your spiritual ancestors were. You didn’t come here from nowhere. There are reasons why you’re here. Learn those reasons. Learn about the stuff that was buried because it was too experimental or embarrassing or inexplicable.</blockquote><cite>Bruce Sterling</cite>',
    '<blockquote>Only those who will risk going too far can possibly find out how far one can go.</blockquote><cite>T. S. Eliot</cite>',
    '<blockquote>The privilege of a lifetime is to become who you truly are.</blockquote><cite>Carl Jung</cite>',
    '<blockquote>It is by going down into the abyss that we recover the treasures of life. Where you stumble, there lies your treasure.</blockquote><cite>Joseph Campbell</cite>',

    '<blockquote>Creative people are especially observant, and they value accurate observation (telling themselves the truth) more than other people do. They often express part-truths, but this they do vividly; the part they express is the generally unrecognized; by displacement of accent and apparent disproportion in statement they seek to point to the usually unobserved. They see things as others do, but also as others do not.</blockquote><cite>David Ogilvy</cite>',

    '<blockquote>The only person you are destined to become is the person you decide to be.</blockquote><cite>Ralph Waldo Emerson</cite>',
    '<blockquote>Too often, convinced of our own intelligence or success, we stay in a comfort zone that ensures that we never feel stupid (and we are never challenged to learn or reconsider what we know). It obscures from view various weaknesses in our understanding, until eventually it\'s too late to change course. This is where the silent toll is taken.</blockquote><cite>Ryan Holliday</cite>',

    '<blockquote>You can fail at what you don\'t want, so you might as well take a shot at what you do.</blockquote><cite>Jim Carrey</cite>',
    '<blockquote>…it struck me what quality went to form a Man of Achievement, especially in Literature, and which Shakespeare possessed so enormously—I mean Negative Capability, that is, when a man is capable of being in uncertainties, mysteries, doubts, without any irritable reaching after fact and reason… with a great poet the sense of Beauty overcomes every other consideration, or rather obliterates all consideration.</blockquote><cite>John Keats</cite>',
    '<blockquote>It is the paradox of human existence that man must simultaneously seek for closeness and for independence; for oneness with others and at the same time for the preservation of his uniqueness and particularity… the answer to this paradox—and to the moral problems of man—is productiveness.</blockquote><cite>Erich Fromm</cite>',
    '<blockquote>Worthy work carries with it the hope of pleasure in rest, the hope of the pleasure in our using what it makes, and the hope of pleasure in our daily creative skill. All other work but this is worthless; it is slaves\' work — mere toiling to live, that we may live to toil.</blockquote><cite>william Morris</cite>',
    '<blockquote>Curiosity is the very basis of education and if you tell me that curiosity killed the cat, I say only the cat died nobly.</blockquote><cite>Arnold Edinborough</cite>',
    '<blockquote>Don\'t ask yourself what the world needs, ask yourself what makes you come alive, and then go and do that. Because what the world needs is people who have come alive.</blockquote><cite>Howard THurman</cite>',
    '<blockquote>Nature demands inequality, hierarchy, subordination of the inferior to the superior—but human history [is] a series of revolts against this natural order, leading to ever greater egalitarianism.</blockquote><cite>Norman Cohn</cite>',
    '<blockquote>If we habitually extinguish boredom with technology instead of allowing the brain to enter default mode, we\'re essentially letting the thought processes that are supposed to help inform our individual stance towards society be endlessly intruded by that very society.</blockquote><cite>Mariah Olson</cite>',
    '<blockquote>The ethical progress of society depends, not on imitating the cosmic process, still less on running away from it, but on combating it.</blockquote><cite>T. H. Huxley</cite>',

    '<blockquote>I don\'t want your love unless you know I am repulsive, and love me even as you know it.</blockquote><cite>Georgess Bataille</cite>',
    '<blockquote>Belonging is the innate human desire to be part of something larger than us. Because this yearning is so primal, we often try to acquire it by fitting in and by seeking approval, which are not only hollow substitutes to belonging, but often barriers to it. Because true belonging only happens when we present our authentic, imperfect selves to the world, our sense of belonging can never be greater than our level of self-acceptance.</blockquote><cite>Brené Brown</cite>',
    '<blockquote>For small creatures such as we the vastness is bearable only through love.</blockquote><cite>Carl Sagan</cite>',
