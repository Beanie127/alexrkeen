# Alex Keen

Hi, I'm Alex.

I’m a storytelling, marketing and design nerd.

During office hours, I’m the Marketing & Communications Manager for [Ferrio](https://www.ferrio.com), the API integration and software automation specialists. 

In my free time, I’m an improviser, writer, tabletop roleplaying game designer and self-taught graphic designer and web developer. I also read a lot.

I live in Sheffield, England with my husband, who [makes beautiful things from wood](https://www.loxleywoodcraft.com/). No pets or children, thank you.

I don’t like social media. If you want to get in touch with me, [just send me an email](mailto:anti-spam-measure-delete-me/alexrkeen@gmx.com?subject=I want to chat).

# Colophon

This site is made in vanilla HTML, CSS and a touch of JavaScript here and there (mostly in my shoebox), all coded by hand in [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/). I host the site on [Neocities](https://neocities.org), using [Deploy to Neocities](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/deploy-to-neocities) to update the site whenever I push changes to my github. It’s typeset in your `system-ui` font. 

# Uses

Here’s a list of the software I use on a near-daily basis. I prefer <abbr>FOSS</abbr> (Free and Open Source Software) where possible, or software with permissive lifetime licensing.

- **Browser:** [Vivaldi](https://vivaldi.com/). Privacy-respecting, feature-heavy, fast Chromium-based browser. Freeware, 95% open-source (the remaining 5% is UI and brand identity).
- **Email client:** [Thunderbird](https://www.thunderbird.net/en-GB/). FOSS.
- **Text editor:** [Typora](https://typora.io/). Writes in Github-Flavoured Markdown, exports almost seamlessly to .html, .doc and .pdf with the help of (open-source) [Pandoc](https://pandoc.org/). One-time payment for a lifetime license.
- **Code editor:** [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/). Freeware.
- **Graphic design & publishing:** I use the fantastic [Affinity Suite by Serif](https://affinity.serif.com/en-gb/). It’s a one-time payment for a lifetime license to Publisher, Photo and Illustrator software that rivals Adobe.
- **Video editing:** [DaVinci Resolve](https://www.blackmagicdesign.com/products/davinciresolve/). Freeware.
- **Audio editing:** [Audacity](https://www.audacityteam.org/). FOSS.

## Self Hosted Software

I have a little computer in my house (a Raspberry Pi 4), connected to the internet and running an operating system called [YunoHost](https://yunohost.org), with a collection of web services that replace things you might use every day, like a search engine, or a cloud storage platform to backup and sync files on your computer.

Why bother? For one thing, it saves me money — I don’t have to pay Google for extra Google Drive storage if I’m hosting it myself. It also protects my privacy. Hosting my own search engine means Microsoft can’t track the websites I visit and use them to target ads at me.

But most importantly (to me), it means I’m in control of the tools I use. Amazon can’t delete an e-book from my account halfway through me reading it; Netflix can’t take my favourite show off my own streaming service. If there’s an update to a piece of software that breaks one of my workflows, I get to decide whether I install that update or not.

If you’re interested in learning more, or taking any of these services for a spin, email me and I’ll create you an account, for free. Here’s what I’m running at the moment:

- **Search Engine:** [SearXNG](https://github.com/searxng/searxng). Metasearch engine which aggregates results from 70+ other search providers. Gives great results with no ads, no tracking and no AI.
- **File Syncing:** [Syncthing](https://syncthing.net). Like Dropbox or Google Drive, but without size limits (besides the server storage capacity) and no tracking.
- **RSS reader:** [FreshRSS](https://freshrss.org/). I follow 100+ blogs, comics and serialised web stories through this. If you’re not familiar with RSS, imagine your podcast feed, but for articles!
- **Recipes:** [Tandoor](https://tandoor.dev). Has decent import functionality, so you can skip the SEO-bait essay that precedes the recipe on every blog nowadays.
- **E-book library & reader:** [Kavita](https://www.kavitareader.com). Looking for a better alternative as the reading UI is pretty awful.
- **PKM:** [SilverBullet](https://silverbullet.md). Primarily useful for making short notes on my phone.
