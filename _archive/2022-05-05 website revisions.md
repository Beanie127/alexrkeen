Hi, I'm Alex.

I’m a storytelling, marketing and design nerd.

During office hours, I’m the Marketing & Communications Manager for [Ferrio](https://www.ferrio.com), the API integration and software automation specialists. 

In my free time, I create award-winning [improv shows](./improv/), write [essays and nonfiction](./writing/), and design websites, [tabletop roleplaying games](./games/) and graphics for shows.

I live in Sheffield, England with my husband, who [makes beautiful things from wood](https://www.loxleywoodcraft.com). No pets or children, thank you.

I don’t like social media. If you want to hire me, collaborate with me, or just have a chat, [reach out here](mailto:alexrkeen@gmx.com?subject=I want to chat).
