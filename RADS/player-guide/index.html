<h1 id='introduction'>Introduction</h1>
<p>Welcome to the <em>RADS</em> Roleplaying Game. <em>RADS</em> is a lightweight system of rules for roleplaying as people with radioactive powers in an alternate version of 1979. </p>
<p>Your character is a <strong>Free Rad</strong>, a seemingly ordinary person who, through exposure to normally deadly radiation, has developed supernatural powers that confound traditional ideas of cause and effect, letting you reshape a portion of reality to your own ends. </p>
<p>You and your friends characters form a cell in the secretive and subversive resistance organisation called The Free Rads, committed to fighting radiation-born monsters called ‘demons’, as well as the scientists, soldiers and secret agents who create and control them. </p>
<p>Individual games of <em>RADS</em> are called <strong>missions</strong>. A mission is likely to take around 6-8 hours to complete, and can be split up over the course of multiple sessions of play. Missions are made up of individual scenes, which usually take place across one continuous span of time, in a single location, and have a single overarching goal. A scene tends to take about 15 to 30 minutes to play out.</p>
<h2 id='how-do-you-play-rads'>How do you play <em>RADS</em>?</h2>
<p>In <em>RADS</em>, you and a group of friends create the story of characters in a fictional world, determining their feelings, beliefs, decisions and actions. </p>
<p>The world and everything that fills it is created by another player called the Game Manager, or <strong>GM</strong>, who describes what your characters see, hear and feel. </p>
<p>Based on this description, and after asking any clarifying questions of the GM, you’ll decide what your character wants to do. </p>
<p>The GM will then use the rules of the system to decide whether it’s possible, how likely it is to succeed, and then one of three things happens:</p>
<ul>
<li>If what you want to do is impossible, they’ll tell you why it can’t happen and you can do something else instead.</li>
<li>If what you want to do is easy or inconsequential, you just… do it, and the GM narrates the results.</li>
<li>If what you want is possible and important, but difficult or unlikely, we break out the dice.</li>

</ul>
<p><em>RADS</em> uses dice of varying sizes and shapes to determine the outcomes of uncertain events, reflecting the role that myriad tiny unpredictable influences play in the outcome. </p>
<h3 id='doing-things-and-rolling-dice'>Doing things and rolling dice</h3>
<p>You roll dice when you attempt to do something which (as determined by the GM):</p>
<ol start='' >
<li>has a chance to succeed or fail, and </li>
<li>has narratively meaningful consequences for success or failure.</li>

</ol>
<p>To determine the outcome of this attempt, you roll one or more dice, increase or decrease the result in accordance with any bonuses and penalties, and compare the result to a target score. If your result meets or exceeds the target score, the roll is a success. If the result does not meet or exceed the target score, you fail.</p>
<p>Whenever you are called upon to roll dice, the number and size of dice to be rolled are described using a standard notation system of XdY, where X is the number of dice to be rolled and Y is the size of the dice. For example, you might be asked to roll 2d6, which means you’ll roll two six-sided dice and add the resulting numbers together. </p>
<blockquote><h2 id='going-undercover'>Going undercover</h2>
<p><strong>GM</strong>: The constable has accepted the forged identity documents marking you as a solicitor. He leaves the room and you are alone with Mr Conington, who looks at you nervously.</p>
<p><strong>Simon</strong> <em>(playing Doug Hertfield):</em> I want to find out what he remembers about the demon attack last night.</p>
<p><strong>GM</strong>: Okay, how do you plan to do that?</p>
<p><strong>Simon</strong>: I’m going to introduce myself, I guess. “Mr Conington, I represent Staples &amp; Masters law firm. We’re here to represent you, if you need it. Can you tell me in your own words what happened last night?</p>
<p><strong>GM</strong>: He knows there’s something weird going on, so he’s on edge. Roll Careful to determine how well you’ve constructed your solicitor disguise.</p>
<p><strong>Simon</strong>: Okay, I have 2d10 for Careful so I should be good. My day job is Bureaucrat, I figure this is kind of that wheelhouse. Will that help?</p>
<p><strong>GM</strong>: Sure, add 2 to the result of your roll.</p>
<p><strong>Simon</strong>:  That’s a 3 and a 5, plus 2, for a total of 10.</p>
<p><strong>GM</strong>: He stares at you for a moment, then bursts into tears, saying “Oh thank goodness you’re here! It was horrible! There was this great big… <em>thing</em>…”</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id='speeds-of-play'>Speeds of play</h3>
<p><em>RADS</em> has two speeds of play: <a href='#scenic-time'>scenic time</a> and <a href='#combat-time'>combat time</a>. For the most part, you’ll be in scenic time. Your Blade acts from minute to minute, responding to challenges as they arise and using your <a href='#your-powers'>Powers</a> to create powerful supernatural effects that reshape reality. When you attempt to overcome an obstacle during scene time, you <a href='#attribute-rolls'>roll dice</a> determined by your <a href='##Your attributes'>attributes</a>, modifying the result if you are using the skills and experience gained in your <a href='#your-day-job'>day job</a>. </p>
<p>Combat time is like a slow motion action sequence in a film. Every second is important as combatants engage in furious conflict. During combat time, you take <a href='#your-turn-in-combat'>turns</a> to act and try to balance acting quickly, <a href='#attacking-and-defending'>attacking the enemy and defending yourself</a>, choosing dice each round to reflect how your character prioritises these <a href='#aspects-and-approaches'>aspects</a>. </p>
<p>Throughout both speeds of play, your character’s most important resource is <a href='#energy'>Energy</a>. Energy lets you turn success into failure, perform logic-defying divine feats and shrug off potentially deadly attacks. Run out, and your character is in trouble.</p>
<h3 id='what-do-you-need-to-play'>What do you need to play?</h3>
<p>To play <em>RADS</em> you will need this guide, 4d6, 3d8 and 2d10 per player (available from any friendly local gaming store) and a group of friends—4 plus you is the perfect number.</p>
<p>One of your group must be willing to take responsibility for the game and do a bit of extra work to make sure everyone else has fun. If you found this game and nobody else volunteers, congratulations! You’re the GM now. Welcome to the club.</p>
<h2 id='what-makes-rads-unique'>What makes <em>RADS</em> unique?</h2>
<p>Different roleplaying systems have different pros and cons, and their mechanics enforce or encourage a certain tone and style of play. </p>
<p><em>RADS</em> features a simple, tactical and setting-rich ruleset with a moderate level of difficulty. It’s designed to tell dark, gritty stories in the sci-fi/thriller genre—think <em>Stranger Things</em> meets <em>Men in Black</em>. Set in an alternate version of our own world circa 1979, standalone missions play out against the backdrop of the Cold War, where the agents of secret government departments present as much of a challenge as paranormal creatures of pure evil.</p>
<p>Your characters are close to the pinnacle of human capabilities in some areas, but only slightly above average in others; they have powers bestowed by exposure to dangerous radiation, which allow them to bend reality, but only within a highly specific scope and only at the expense of their own vital energy; and while the so-called demons they face are challenging to defeat in combat, the greater obstacles are the secret governmental/military organisations who create these demons for nefarious purposes.</p>
<p>If you play other games or are designing your own RPG, you are encouraged to shamelessly borrow mechanics or narrative concepts from <em>RADS</em>. Remember, every new idea is a remix of everything that came before, novelty matters less than you think, and game mechanics can’t be copyrighted or owned!</p>
<h2 id='advice-for-enjoyment'>Advice for enjoyment</h2>
<p><em>RADS</em> puts the players in the position of morally ambiguous characters with supernatural powers, fighting people warped into unrecognisable monsters by exposure to nuclear radiation. While these transformations are a work of science fiction, there are many horrifying real-world examples of traumatic and deadly experiments conducted on ignorant or unwilling individuals by government-backed agencies. Almost always, these experiments took place at the expense of social outsiders, minorities and disprivileged members of society. Because of the reality-adjacent historical setting of this game, themes of discrimination and social inequality in wider society also have the potential to arise.</p>
<p>Part of the intended appeal of the game is to be able to explore these themes within a safe context, and doing so requires everyone at the table to actively prioritise player safety and support others when they feel unsafe. Below, we outline some things to consider before you start playing.</p>
<h3 id='safety'>Safety</h3>
<p>Some players may find themselves uncomfortable or upset by events which happen or themes which arise during play. If this happens to you, you have permission to pause or stop play in whatever way you wish. If someone else pauses or stops the game, don’t interrogate them about why they feel uncomfortable. Instead, ask if there’s anything you can do to support them and make them feel more comfortable, and accept their responses.</p>
<p>The author encourages and supports the use of the <a href='bit.ly/ttrpgsafetytoolkit'>ttrpg safety toolkit</a>, written by Kienna Shaw and Lauren Bryant-Monk.</p>
<p>The tools presented are intended to aid in preventing players from harm, physical or otherwise, before, during and after play. Using these tools is not mandatory, nor does the use of these tools preclude the use of other mechanisms for protecting player safety.</p>
<p>Use your best judgement: if someone expresses discomfort in a way other than by asking you to stop, even if they do so apparently jokingly, or acts in a way that makes you think they might be uncomfortable, it’s better to stop and check than let someone continue to struggle.</p>
<p>While the GM holds a unique degree of power over the narrative and the rules in a way that other players do not, running a game doesn’t mean they are solely accountable for the safety of others at the table, or that they are immune to being made uncomfortable by events that arise during play. It is the equal responsibility of everyone at the table to look after one another and work together to create a safe, enjoyable environment in which to roleplay.</p>
<h3 id='prejudice'>Prejudice</h3>
<p>The world of <em>RADS</em> is very similar to the 1970s in our own universe. Across the majority of our planet at that time, racism, sexism, homophobia and other prejudiced views were prevalent and members of disprivileged groups often faced severe discrimination.</p>
<p>When you sit down to play for the first time, your table should discuss how they want to address this in-game. The safest option is to set your game in a world where these issues do not exist and people are not judged based on their ethnicity, sex, neurodiversity, sexuality or gender identity, allowing your table to play diverse characters without worrying about creating additional challenges or rubbing against sore topics.</p>
<p>Some people find roleplaying games to be a powerful lens through which to examine and explore issues of privilege and prejudice, finding enjoyment or catharsis in stories where characters overcome oppression and disprivilege in the course of their adventures. If your table agrees to engage with these topics in this way, ensure that everyone is fully onboard with doing so, and make opportunities for regular check-ins between scenes and at the end of sessions to address any questions or potentially problematic topics that have arisen during play.</p>
<p>If you do decide to embrace period-realistic moral attitudes, be careful when portraying non-player characters who have offensive opinions. While characters with objectionable views may be useful as a foil for underdog protagonists, making such characters overly sympathetic can come across as an endorsement of their views. The author strongly recommends you avoid creating prejudiced player characters.</p>
<p>The author holds the following statements to be morally indisputable:</p>
<ul>
<li>abortions are a woman’s right</li>
<li>Black Lives Matter</li>
<li>it’s okay to be gay</li>
<li>trans rights are human rights</li>
<li>Fascists can fuck off</li>

</ul>
<p>If you cannot agree with these principles or are not willing to prioritise player safety, this game is not meant for you and you are not allowed to play it.</p>
<h1 id='character-creation'>Character Creation</h1>
<p>Creating a Free Rad is quick, simple and can even be done at random, to explore characters you wouldn’t otherwise play.</p>
<h3 id='determine-your-attributes'>Determine your attributes.</h3>
<p>Characters in <em>RADS</em> have three <em>attributes</em>, qualities they use to overcome challenges: <em>forceful</em>, <em>quick</em>, and <em>careful</em>. Pick your best attribute; when you use it, roll 2d10. Pick your worst attribute; when you use it, roll 2d6. Your character is average with their remaining attribute; when you use it, roll 2d8.</p>
<h3 id='choose-a-day-job'>Choose a day job.</h3>
<p>Select from <em>law enforcement, driver, bureaucrat, medic, tradesman, performer, criminal, journalist,</em> or roll 1d8 to assign at random. Note the <strong>talents</strong> you gain.</p>
<h3 id='choose-your-powers'>Choose your <a href='#your-powers'>Powers</a>.</h3>
<p>Select a gift from <em>warding, illusion, wildspeech, compulsion</em> and <em>divination</em>, or roll 1d6 to assign at random, re-rolling on a 6. Note the Powers you gain.</p>
<h3 id='choose-a-combat-speciality'>Choose a <a href='#your-combat-speciality'>combat speciality</a>.</h3>
<p>Select from <em>brutal, tough, alert, strategic, speedy</em> and <em>unconventional</em>, or roll 1d6 to assign at random.</p>
<h3 id='choose-two-tactical-moves'>Choose two <a href='#tactical-moves'>tactical moves</a>.</h3>
<p>Select from <em>advance, delay, aid, sabotage, quicken, slow, flurry, savage, counter</em> and <em>protect</em>, or roll 2d10 to assign at random, re-rolling duplicates.</p>
<h3 id='write-them-up'>Write them up</h3>
<p>Put your character’s details into a character sheet, along with their starting Energy (24), movement (6 spaces, unless you have the ‘speedy’ combat speciality) and name (up to you!).</p>
<p>The resulting character will look a bit like this:</p>
<figure><table>
<thead>
<tr><th>Name</th><th><span style='text-align: left; font-weight: normal;'>George Tiller</span></th></tr></thead>
<tbody><tr><td><strong>Energy</strong></td><td>24</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Movement</strong></td><td>6 spaces</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Attributes</strong></td><td><em>Forceful:</em> 2d8<br><em>Quick:</em> 2d6<br><em>Careful:</em> 2d10</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Day job</strong></td><td>Medic (talents: triage, CPR)</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Powers</strong></td><td>warding (alarm, sanctify, repel)</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Combat Speciality</strong></td><td>tough</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Tactical Moves</strong></td><td>protect, slow</td></tr></tbody>
</table></figure>
<h2 id='what-makes-a-good-rads-character'>What makes a good <em>RADS</em> character?</h2>
<p>Free Rads come from diverse cultural and socioeconomic backgrounds. Feel free to create a rich other life for your character, bearing in mind the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Physically, being a Free Rad means your character is a competent and capable investigator who is willing and able to fight when necessary. </li>
<li>Personality-wise, your character can be, want, feel, say and do whatever you like, as long as this does not conflict with working alongside the other Free Rads to complete your missions.</li>
<li>In terms of relationships, you and your fellow players’ characters are part of the same cell of the Free Rads, and should know one another at least professionally and be committed to working together.</li>
<li>Morally, no matter their background, all Free Rads share a drive to protect the innocent, minimise damage, suppress awareness of demons’ existence and banish them from the world for good.</li>

</ul>
<h3 id='are-there-any-characters-you-cant-play'>Are there any characters you can&#39;t play?</h3>
<p>As well as being a game, an RPG is an engine for cooperative storytelling. <em>RADS</em> is designed to tell a certain kind of story, and pushing to tell a different kind of story during a game could undermine the enjoyment of everyone else at the table. The above passage describes the kinds of characters who suit the stories which <em>RADS</em> is designed to tell. Some character concepts just don’t fit into this mould.</p>
<p>Pacifists or weaklings who can&#39;t or won&#39;t engage in a physical fight; lone wolves or loose cannons who don’t play by the rules or work with others; or contrarians and conspiracists who think that civilians aren’t worth protecting, that demons shouldn’t be kept hidden, that “the government is right” or that “the Free Rads are the true demons”; stories about these characters might be exciting, nuanced and well worth exploring, but they’re probably best explored elsewhere.</p>
<p>With all that having been said, this is a book. It has no power to stop you from playing those characters if you want. Just discuss it with your GM and the rest of the table first, and caveat ludio.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id='your-day-job'>Your day job</h2>
<p>Between missions, a Free Rad lives a normal life and works a fairly normal job. In the course of a mission, your character can use the skills and demeanour they’ve developed in their everyday existence, as well as using their day job as a cover to conceal their true purposes to other people they interact with.</p>
<p>Your <strong>day job</strong> grants you the following benefits:</p>
<ol start='' >
<li>You have two <strong>talents</strong>, which allow to automatically succeed at certain tasks that would be incredibly difficult or impossible to anyone untrained in your field, no roll required. </li>
<li>When you’re attempting an action that would be easier for someone with the experience and skills in your day job, you get a +1 bonus to the <strong>attribute roll</strong>.</li>
<li>While interacting with people, you get a +2 bonus to any attribute rolls relating to covering up your true motives and other relevant social interactions, as long as you’re behaving normally for someone with your day job. This is called a <strong>cover bonus</strong>.</li>

</ol>
<p>When you create a Free Rad, you can choose from the following day jobs and flesh out the exact details of what your character does, choosing from the example jobs given or coming up with your own. You gain the associated talents, which don’t require a roll. </p>
<figure><table>
<thead>
<tr><th style='text-align:center;' >Day job</th><th>Talent 1</th><th>Talent 2</th></tr></thead>
<tbody><tr><td style='text-align:center;' >Bureaucrat</td><td><em>Typo:</em> Once per scene, you can automatically spot a mistake, omission or deception in any paperwork or documentation.</td><td><em>Chapter and verse:</em> Once per mission, you can convince a civilian by citing obscure regulations or producing forged paperwork, ID or records.</td></tr><tr><td style='text-align:center;' >Criminal</td><td><em>Case the joint:</em> Once per scene, you can identify camera blind spots and security weaknesses in even the most heavily fortified area.</td><td><em>No questions asked:</em> Once per mission, you can acquire an object worth up to $100.</td></tr><tr><td style='text-align:center;' >Driver</td><td><em>10-4:</em> Once per scene, you can radio a fellow driver and automatically find out something useful about the local area.</td><td><em>Eat my dust:</em> Once per mission, you can shake off even the most determined pursuer in a vehicular chase.</td></tr><tr><td style='text-align:center;' >Journalist</td><td><em>Wheedle:</em> Once per scene, you can convince anyone to tell you their side of the story.</td><td><em>Red herring:</em> Once per mission, you can trick a civilian who’s getting close to the truth to follow a false lead.</td></tr><tr><td style='text-align:center;' >Law Enforcement Officer</td><td><em>Pull the files:</em> Once per scene, you can give a name to your contact on the force and automatically find out any criminal records they hold.</td><td><em>Mirandize:</em> Once per mission, you can safely restrain a civilian or knock them unconscious.</td></tr><tr><td style='text-align:center;' >Medic</td><td><em>Triage:</em> Once per scene, you can automatically identify injuries and diseases, as well as medicines, drugs and their effects.</td><td><em>CPR:</em> Once per mission, you can staunch a fatally injured person’s wounds, keeping them at the edge of life until they can get to a hospital.</td></tr><tr><td style='text-align:center;' >Performer</td><td><em>Character study:</em> Once per scene, you can automatically tell when someone is lying and what emotion motivates them to deception.</td><td><em>No autographs:</em> Once per mission, you can leverage your minor fame to a civilian, enlisting their aid or convincing them of the need for secrecy.</td></tr><tr><td style='text-align:center;' >Manual Labourer</td><td><em>Breaker:</em> Once per scene, you can automatically disrupt or repair any utility supply to a building.</td><td><em>Cordon off:</em> Once per mission, you can make civilians evacuate an area by convincing them that they’re at risk from an environmental threat.</td></tr></tbody>
</table></figure>
<h3 id='breaking-cover'>Breaking cover</h3>
<p>If you fail a roll while benefiting from a cover bonus, or if you’re caught acting in a manner that obviously deviates from normal behaviour for your day job, any person who is observing you at the time will become suspicious. You no longer benefit from your cover bonus when interacting with this person, and depending on their disposition and what you’ve been doing, they may actively work to thwart your efforts. Failing an attribute roll that benefits from a +1 bonus from your day job doesn’t raise suspicion in this way.</p>
<h2 id='your-powers'>Your Powers</h2>
<p>All Free Rads have <strong>Powers</strong>, gained after their exposure to gamma radiation. All Powers bend reality, and each gift is useful to a Free Rad in a different way, with its own unique rules and restrictions on its use. Unless otherwise specified, Powers can affect civilians, Rads and demons alike.</p>
<h3 id='illusion'>Illusion</h3>
<p>An <em>illusion</em> twists the senses, casting doubt and sowing confusion. An illusion affects the mind of a select group of creatures, making a target disappear for them, making them see a target differently, or making them see a target that doesn’t truly exist. The target can be an object or a creature.</p>
<p>Characters with the gift of illusion are called <em>illusionists</em>; they gain the following illusion Powers:</p>
<figure><table>
<thead>
<tr><th style='text-align:center;' >Power</th><th><span style="text-align:left;">Effect</span></th><th style='text-align:center;' >Resist</th></tr></thead>
<tbody><tr><td style='text-align:center;' >Conceal</td><td>Affected creatures cannot see or hear the target.</td><td style='text-align:center;' >Quick</td></tr><tr><td style='text-align:center;' >Transform</td><td>To affected creatures, the appearance of the target is exchanged for a creation of similar size and shape.</td><td style='text-align:center;' >Quick</td></tr><tr><td style='text-align:center;' >Conjure</td><td>Affected creatures perceive a being or object which does not exist in the target area.</td><td style='text-align:center;' >Quick</td></tr></tbody>
</table></figure>
<h4 id='the-rules-of-illusion'>The rules of Illusion</h4>
<p>Illusions have no physical presence and are purely visual manifestations, having no affect on sound, smell, nor do they affect temperature or airflow in a space. To create an illusion, you must be touching the target of the illusion or the target space where the illusion will appear. They can be of any size.</p>
<p>An illusion placed on a static object, or a static illusion on a fixed location, lasts for 1 hour. Moving illusions last for 5 minutes. When you create an illusion, you can choose to double the length of the illusion; doing so causes you to lose 1 additional Energy. You can do this multiple times, doubling the length each time, up to a maximum of length of 24 hours.</p>
<p>When you attempt to use an illusion Power, choose which creatures you wish to be affected. You can choose specific individuals who you wish to affect, or specify some group, for example “the next three people to walk past this doorway”, and you can exclude creatures as well, for example your fellow Free Rads.</p>
<p>The cost of using an illusion Power is twice the number of affected creatures.</p>
<p>While you are using an illusion Power, the target is faintly lit up with shifting colours and patterns. If the target of your illusion is an unwilling creature and they are aware that an illusion has been placed on them, they may attempt to resist it once using Quick. If they fail, they cannot attempt this again.</p>
<p>If any creature affected by an illusion is presented with evidence that the effect they perceive is fake, they can attempt to resist it. If they succeed, they no longer see the effect. If they fail, they do not suspect the truth and continue to believe that the effect is real until the illusion is out of sight or ends. Illusions affect creatures independently; one creature could overcome an illusion and cease to perceive the effect while another continues to be affected by it.</p>
<h3 id='wildspeech'>Wildspeech</h3>
<p>Wildspeech is the ability to communicate with animals. Both greater and lesser than language, it allows for a mutual respect and understanding beyond words, but not the translation of complex concepts.</p>
<p>Rads with the gift of wildspeech are called <em>wildspeakers</em>; they gain the following wildspeech Powers:</p>
<figure><table>
<thead>
<tr><th style='text-align:center;' >Power</th><th><span style="text-align:left;">Effect</span></th></tr></thead>
<tbody><tr><td style='text-align:center;' >Roam</td><td>Designate a location within a minute’s travel for the animal. The target will travel to the location; as it does so, your own senses are suppressed and you perceive what the target perceives.</td></tr><tr><td style='text-align:center;' >Urge</td><td>Describe a single action the target can complete within a minute. The target will perform the task, provided doing so will not put it in immediate danger.</td></tr><tr><td style='text-align:center;' >Recall</td><td>Ask the target 3 questions about events in the last 48 hours, within a distance of your current location that the target can travel in a minute.</td></tr></tbody>
</table></figure>
<h4 id='the-rules-of-wildspeech'>The rules of wildspeech</h4>
<p>When you attempt to use a wildspeech Power, you draw an animal to you from the surrounding area (within a minute’s travel for the animal), choosing to call either a beast of the sky, the land or the water to be the target of the miracle. You will always have to provide an offering of food to the animal.</p>
<p>The cost of using a wildspeech Power is determined by how far you are from true wilderness. In complete wilderness, the cost is 2. If you can see a human-made structure, the cost is 4. If you are stood on human-made ground, the cost is 6. If you cannot see the sky because of a human-made covering, the cost is 8.</p>
<p>While you are using a wildspeech Power, your eyes glow faintly green, the air around you moves with a gentle breeze, and a faint smell of fresh pine permeates the vicinity. </p>
<p>Wildspeech temporarily imbues animals with a sense of trust, respect and cooperation toward the wildspeaker, but not improved mental or physical abilities. Wildspeech cannot cause an animal to fight or risk its own life. </p>
<p>Animals cannot attempt to resist the effects of wildspeech.</p>
<h3 id='compulsion'>Compulsion</h3>
<p>Compulsion warps the minds of living things, putting them at the mercy of another’s will. Where illusion touches the senses, intercepting the message between eye and brain, compulsion magic can affect personality, if only for a while. Compulsions affect beliefs, actions and intentions.</p>
<p>Rads with the gift of compulsion are called <em>mesmerists</em>; they gain the following compulsion Powers:</p>
<figure><table>
<thead>
<tr><th style='text-align:center;' >Power</th><th><span style="text-align:left;">Effect</span></th><th style='text-align:center;' >Resist</th></tr></thead>
<tbody><tr><td style='text-align:center;' >Mislead</td><td>The target believes a false statement. They will ignore any evidence which would disprove this statement, and go to any lengths to justify their belief if questioned, though any challenge to their false reality will exacerbate the side-effects of the compulsion.</td><td style='text-align:center;' >Quick</td></tr><tr><td style='text-align:center;' >Command</td><td>The target follows a single order. They will go to almost any lengths to carry out the order, save injuring themselves or their loved ones.</td><td style='text-align:center;' >Forceful</td></tr><tr><td style='text-align:center;' >Incite</td><td>The target feels one emotion, very strongly. They are practically consumed by this emotion.</td><td style='text-align:center;' >Careful</td></tr></tbody>
</table></figure>
<h4 id='the-rules-of-compulsion'>The rules of compulsion</h4>
<p>The cost of using a compulsion Power is the target’s will score.</p>
<p>While you are using a compulsion Power, the target is unaware of anything unusual happening. Anyone else present hears an unnatural resonance to your voice and sees your hands moving gently past the target’s face in hypnotic patterns.</p>
<p>At the moment you finish using a compulsion Power, you utter a single sentence which changes the target’s mind. A compulsion can make a target believe, feel or do almost anything, save injure themselves or their loved ones, but a target compelled to act against their nature becomes pale, glassy-eyed, clumsy, dim-witted and slow. The further the target  strays from their nature, the more obvious the effects.</p>
<p>A target remains under the effect of the compulsion for 1 hour. When a compulsion would end, you can choose to extend the duration of the compulsion by another hour if you and the target can see one another. Doing so causes you to lose 2 Energy for each hour the compulsion has already lasted, up to a maximum length of 24 hours. If a compulsion ends naturally, the target remembers nothing unless encouraged to recall and given ample insight into what happened.</p>
<p>A target cannot freely attempt to resist a compulsion. However, a target submerged in running water automatically resists the compulsion. If a target successfully ends the compulsion in this way, they remember everything.</p>
<h3 id='warding'>Warding</h3>
<p>Warding divides the world into inside and outside, reinforcing material barriers and creating powerful spaces. Wards are invisible magical barriers at the perimeter of a clearly defined target space. Wards separate outside from inside and affect civilians, demons and Rads who enter, occupy or leave the space.</p>
<p>Blades with the gift of warding are called <em>wardens</em>; they gain the following warding Powers:</p>
<figure><table>

<h4 id='the-rules-of-warding'>The rules of warding</h4>
<p>You can ward any single target space, regardless of size, as long as its perimeter is clearly defined by solid barriers such as walls and a ceiling. The space must be one single area within; a room is an acceptable target, a building with multiple rooms within is not. A gap in the perimeter larger than 2 metres in any dimension makes a space impossible to ward. To ward a space, you must be touching its perimeter.</p>
<p>The cost of using a warding Power is equal to the number of openings in the perimeter of the target space through which a human being could comfortably pass with ease. Include unlocked doors, windows or passageways out of a room.</p>
<p>While you are creating a ward, the target space feels physically warm and emits a faint glow. Once created, alarm and sanctify wards are imperceptible; repel wards will be apparent to anyone affected.</p>
<p>A ward persists for 24 hours. A space cannot be warded with multiple wards.</p>
<p>A creature who is affected by a ward automatically attempts to resist it when they enter a warded space for the first time. If they succeed, the ward ceases to affect them permanently, but continues to exist for other creatures. Whether they fail or succeed, they won’t be aware that the ward exists if it is a sanctify or alarm ward. Wards affect creatures independently; one creature could overcome a ward, while another still feels its effects.</p>
<h3 id='divination'>Divination</h3>
<p>Divination grants insight into things far away, things long gone or things still yet to transpire, if you have the insight to unpick the visions you receive.</p>
<p>Rads with the gift of divination are called <em>diviners</em>; they gain the following divination Powers:</p>
<figure><table>

You see a vision of that target event.</td></tr><tr><td style='text-align:center;' >Locate</td><td>Describe a target object, or creature. If the target is within 8 miles, you gain a momentary sense of its current location in relation to you and a vision of its surroundings.</td></tr><tr><td style='text-align:center;' >Predict</td><td>Describe a course of action you wish to take in the future that would require a roll to achieve. If the target action is doomed to failure, you learn why.

<h4 id='the-rules-of-divination'>The rules of divination</h4>
<p>To use a divination Power, you need a reflective surface, such as a mirror or a pool of still water, which you gaze into as you contemplate the subject of your divination. </p>
<p>The cost of using a divination Power is set by fate: roll a d8 to determine the cost. </p>
<p>While you are using a divination Power, the air around you grows cold and the reflective surface into which you gaze appears darkened to all others. Other creatures who look at it for more than a few seconds experience a piercing headache. </p>
<p>Divination effects are instantaneous and cannot be resisted.</p>
<h2 id='your-combat-speciality'>Your combat speciality</h2>
<p>Player characters each have a <strong>combat speciality</strong> reflecting their unique training, skills and experience. These bestow small passive benefits which change the outcome of certain roll results. You choose one combat speciality when you create your character.</p>

</table></figure>
<h1 id='energy'>Energy</h1>
<p>Both materially and metaphorically, <strong>Energy</strong> is your Free Rad’s vital essence. It determines your character’s ability to push themselves to overcome the odds, perform miracles, and shrug off harm. Your character starts each mission with 24 Energy and can lose or gain Energy from scene to scene.</p>
<h2 id='losing-energy'>Losing Energy</h2>
<p>At certain points throughout a mission, you will lose Energy. There are certain ways you can lose Energy voluntarily, either to make something good happen or avoid something bad from happening; you can also be made to lose Energy.</p>
<p>There are three main ways you can lose Energy:</p>
<h3 id='sustaining-physical-or-mental-injury'>Sustaining physical or mental injury</h3>
<p>While in <strong>scenic time</strong>, you might attempt to overcome an obstacle in a way that puts you in physical or psychological danger. If you fail an <strong>attribute roll</strong>, the GM might cause you to lose Energy as a result.</p>
<p>During <strong>combat time</strong>, Energy reflects your ability to weather minor injuries and keep on fighting. You lose Energy every time an opponent targets you with an attack and you fail your <strong>defence roll</strong>. </p>
<p>Losing Energy from physical or mental injury can leave you with a negative Energy total.</p>
<h3 id='rerolling-a-failed-attribute-roll'>Rerolling a failed attribute roll</h3>
<p>When you fail an attribute roll while in scenic time, you have an opportunity to redeem yourself at the cost of losing Energy. Explain how you recover from your mistake, lose 3 Energy and make another attribute roll. If the second roll also fails, you can’t try again. You can’t reroll a failed attribute roll if doing so would cause you to drop below 0 Energy.</p>
<h3 id='using-your-powers'>Using your Powers</h3>
<p>Using your <strong>Powers</strong> also costs you Energy. Each set of Powers determines the cost differently. You can’t use a Power if the cost of doing so would leave you with a negative Energy total.</p>
<h3 id='other-ways-to-lose-energy'>Other ways to lose Energy</h3>
<ul>
<li>taking the lead on a group attribute roll costs 2 Energy</li>
<li>prematurely ending an effect from your Powers costs 1 Energy</li>
<li>using a <strong>tactical move</strong> in combat time costs 1 Energy</li>

</ul>
<h2 id='negative-energy'>Negative Energy</h2>
<p>When you run out of Energy, you enter negative Energy, which sucks. While you have negative Energy, you decrease the result of every roll you make by the value of your negative Energy score. In addition, the number of spaces you can move each round in combat is decreased by your negative Energy score.  </p>
<p>If you receive damage for any reason while at 0 Energy or lower, you lose 1 Energy instead of what you would usually lose. If your Energy ever reaches -6, you die. Once you are dead, there is no coming back.</p>
<p>While in scenic time, a fellow Free Rad can return you to 0 Energy with a successful attribute roll. This cannot be attempted during combat time. The target number for this roll is 8, plus the value of your negative Energy score (so if you have -4 Energy, the target number is 12). Any attribute roll can be attempted, provided the player can give sufficient justification for how their attempt helps you regain your strength and spirit. Characters can work together using the usual rules.</p>
<p>On a failure, any characters who participated cannot try again, and you lose 1 Energy. If you end a scene with negative Energy, your character’s injuries are too great and they die.</p>
<h2 id='regaining-energy'>Regaining Energy</h2>
<p>After you drop out of combat time, you regain 1d6 Energy if you have 0 or more Energy, up to your maximum (usually 24). Characters with negative Energy remain at their current Energy value. </p>
<p>If you wish to regain more Energy, you can choose to have your character spend a scene resting and recuperating while the rest of the team continue with the mission. When you do this, your character regains 2d6+6 Energy at the start of the following scene. Any number of characters can do this at once and you can choose to all rest for the length of a scene, but doing so will leave you with a worse situation when you return to the mission, as rival forces all take their chance to advance their nefarious agendas.</p>
<h1 id='scenic-time'>Scenic Time</h1>
<p>Most of the events of a <strong>mission</strong> will take place in <strong>scenic time</strong>. While in scenic time, you’ll be presented with a situation by the GM and given free reign to decide how you respond to it. Play unfolds very much like a conversation, where you say what you want to do, and the GM determines the consequences. Your overarching goal for a scene will be determined by the events of the mission so far, but how you go about achieving that goal—the strategy you pursue, the tactics you use—is up to you. </p>
<p>For the most part, you can just say what you want to do, and if it’s reasonable, it’ll happen. If it’s not possible for some reason, the GM will explain why and you can do something else instead. This might happen because of some factor you hadn’t considered, or something the GM neglected to mention, and it’s easiest to simply acknowledge the confusion and move on.</p>
<p>While scenic time tends to proceed in a fairly linear fashion most of the time, it’s likely that at some points, you’ll find yourself discussing a plan as a group and then realise that it relies on you having done something you <em>obviously would have done</em>, had your characters been having the conversation at the time when they <em>obviously would have had that conversation</em>. In this case, it’s fine to rewind a little and establish that you definitely actually did that thing.</p>
<h2 id='attribute-rolls'>Attribute rolls</h2>
<p>In the course of a scene, you’ll face various obstacles which prevent you from completing an immediate goal. An obstacle might be physical—a locked door that bars your way, a blaring siren alerting everyone to your presence—or it could be a person who won’t answer your questions, or worse, insists they want to help you out.</p>
<p>When you attempt to overcome a meaningful obstacle like this, the GM will ask you how you intend to try to overcome the obstacles in your way. Depending on your response, the GM will decide which of your <strong>attributes</strong> is most relevant, then ask you to roll your dice for that attribute. This is called an <strong>attribute roll</strong>. </p>

<blockquote><h2 id='making-an-attribute-roll'>Making an attribute roll</h2>
<p><strong>GM</strong>: If the security guard gets around that corner, he’s going to see the demon and you’ll have another witness on your hands. What are you going to do?</p>
<p><strong>Gabrielle</strong> <em>(playing Chrissie LeStrange):</em> Argh! I’m going to start a fight with him. I’m going to challenge him to a fight.</p>
<p><strong>GM</strong>: Sounds like you’re being Forceful. Make an attribute roll.</p>
<p><strong>Gabrielle</strong>: I’ve only got 2d6 for forceful… can I set off running away and see if he’ll chase me?</p>
<p><strong>GM</strong>: Sure, I guess you can be Quick.</p>
<p><strong>Gabrielle</strong>: Okay, that’s 2d8… I got a 3!</p>
<p><strong>GM</strong>: You turn to sprint, but he’s faster than you thought and dives for you, knocking you down. As you look up at him from the ground, you can see the demon’s shadow on the wall behind him…</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id='target-scores'>Target scores</h3>
<p>The GM will set a <strong>target score</strong> based on how difficult the task is. If the result of your roll meets or beats the target score, you succeed, otherwise you fail. </p>
<p>The default target score for an attribute roll is 9, meaning a roll with your highest attribute is slightly more likely to succeed than fail, a roll with one of your middle attributes is slightly more likely to fail than succeed, and a roll with your lowest attribute is likely to fail. The GM may decrease or increase the target score to reflect beneficial or detrimental circumstances.</p>
<h4 id='failing-an-attribute-roll'>Failing an attribute roll</h4>
<p>Failing to overcome an obstacle is never good. Depending on the obstacle, failure might mean drawing undue attention to yourself, sustaining an injury or losing a promising lead; it will always make it harder for you and your fellow Free Rads to achieve your goal for the scene.</p>
<p>Luckily, you always have a chance to make things right, at the cost of <a href='#energy'>Energy</a>. When you fail an attribute roll, you can choose to lose 3 Energy and reroll your dice, describing how you attempt to snatch victory from the jaws of defeat. If you succeed, disaster is averted; if you fail, you might just make things even worse.</p>
<h3 id='working-together'>Working together</h3>
<p>For some activities, such as climbing a wall or lifting a heavy object, having multiple people contributing to the outcome can make the task easier. The GM is the final arbiter of whether you can attempt to work together on a task. If so, the task becomes easier: the target number to overcome the obstacle is reduced by 2. However, the cost of failure is also increased: both players must roll against the number, and if either fails to meet or exceed the target number, both characters suffer any consequences of failure.</p>
<p>Other obstacles, for example sneaking through a patrolled building, will require everyone’s participation, but having one person take the lead makes things easier for the others. The leader loses 2 Energy when they make the attribute roll. If the leader succeeds, the target number to overcome the obstacle is reduced by 4 for the other players. </p>
<blockquote><h2 id='failure-and-cooperation'>Failure and cooperation</h2>
<p><strong>Sandra</strong> <em>(playing Martina Hernandez):</em> Urgh! I rolled 2d10 and got a 4 on my Careful roll to climb over the roof.</p>
<p><strong>GM</strong>: The rooftop is wet and slippery, and in the dark you lose your balance and fall down the roof. What do you do?</p>
<p><strong>Sandra</strong>: I’m going to reroll. I want to try and catch the guttering before I fall off completely.</p>
<p><strong>GM</strong>: Lose three Energy and make me another Quick roll. I’m going to warn you, this will be difficult.</p>
<p><strong>Dion</strong> <em>(playing Eddie Grimes):</em> Can I try and catch her hand as she falls past to make it easier?</p>
<p><strong>GM</strong>: You sure can, but I’ll need a roll from both of you. If you fail, you’re both in trouble.</p>
<p><strong>Sandra</strong>: I got a 9 this time!</p>
<p><strong>Dion</strong>: That’s an 8 from me, and my day job is Criminal, so I’m used to rooftop shenanigans. Can I bump that up to a 9?</p>
<p><strong>GM</strong>: You can, but you don’t need to: 8 is enough from both of you. As Martina slips, Eddie’s hand shoots out and grasps firmly. You halt her slide down the roof and find stability again.</p>
<p><strong>Sandra</strong>: Phew! “Thanks, Eddie.”</p>
<p><strong>Dion</strong>: “No problem, kiddo. Now let’s get back to work.”</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id='using-powers'>Using Powers</h2>
<p>All Rads have special <strong>Powers</strong> granted by exposure to radiation, allowing them to expend their Energy to manipulate the civilians, demons, and the environment around them. Your Rad has three such Powers. </p>
<p>Powers always have a <strong>target</strong>: this could be an object, a player character, a civilian, a demon or even a geographical space. Each Power has a different <strong>effect</strong>. </p>
<p>Using a Power takes one minute, during which time you are in a state of intense focus, putting all your attention on the target of the Power and leaving you unable to achieve any parallel goals. If you are interrupted before a minute has passed, you lose 2 Energy and you must start again.</p>
<p>A Power always has a <strong>cost</strong>, and each set of powers uses a different method to determine that cost. When you use a Power, you lose Energy equal to the cost.</p>
<p>You cannot use a Power when doing so could cause you to drop into negative Energy.</p>
<h3 id='ending-an-effect'>Ending an effect</h3>
<p>If a Power has an ongoing effect, you can end an effect you created at any time. Doing so causes you to lose 1 Energy.</p>
<p>If you are the subject of an effect or a demon’s influence, you can attempt to <strong>resist</strong> the effect, but doing so causes you to lose 4 Energy from the strain. You’ll make an attribute roll determined by the nature of the effect; if you fail, you can’t try again in the same scene. When you end a scene under the influence of an effect, you can attempt to overcome it for free without losing Energy.</p>
<p>A non-player character subject to an effect created by you can attempt to resist it. When a creature tries to resist an effect from your Power, roll a d6. The cost to maintain the effect is the creature’s score for the attribute associated with that Power, less the result of the roll. To maintain the effect, lose Energy equal to this cost, otherwise the effect ends. If losing this Energy would take you into negative Energy, the effect of your Power ends automatically. </p>
<blockquote><h2 id='lying-to-children'>Lying to children</h2>
<p><strong>Elise</strong> <em>(playing Gregor Portnov):</em> “This poor child shouldn’t have to bear the burden of remembering that hideous creature.” Plus, I don’t want to have to kill a child to cover up the demon’s presence, it’s too messy. I’m going to compel her to believe that she fell asleep and had a nightmare, using ‘mislead’.</p>
<p><strong>GM</strong>: Okay, well she’s currently sat in shock, so you shouldn’t have much trouble getting her to cooperate, and there are no bystanders to worry about either. Her will score is 3, so it’s not a high cost, but this is going to make her pretty dopey for the next hour.</p>
<p><strong>Elise</strong>: That’s fine, when her parents show up we’ll find an excuse. </p>
<p><strong>GM</strong>: I look forward to that excuse! Gregor approaches the girl and begins whispering to her in a soft voice. Her eyes are full with unshed tears, but as the watch on a chain falls from your hand in front of her face, the expression fades until she’s just sat blankly, awaiting your instruction. Lose 3 Energy and tell me what you’re saying to her.</p>
<p><strong>Elise</strong>: “You fell asleep while on the bus home from school and had a horrible nightmare.” Okay, then I snap my fingers and begin acting like I’m just a concerned bystander. </p>

<h1 id='combat-time'>Combat Time</h1>
<p>Combat is a dangerous but inevitable part of the life of a Free Rad. When you come into conflict with a hostile force and cannot find a peaceful solution, the timescale of play shifts to track every movement and action. </p>
<p>Combat in <em>RADS</em> is fast-paced and unpredictable. <strong>Attributes</strong> and <strong>day jobs</strong> mean nothing when it comes to conflict—whether they rely on body or mind, force or finesse, all player characters are assumed to be equally competent in battle. Likewise <strong>Powers</strong>, whose effects are measured in minutes, hours and days, are insignificant compared to the immediate reality of violence. What matters more than anything else are the choices you make from second to second.</p>
<h2 id='your-turn-in-combat'>Your turn in combat</h2>
<p>Combat time is divided into <strong>rounds</strong>, each lasting about ten seconds, and each combatant has their own <strong>turn</strong> to act. A round of combat looks like this:</p>
<ol start='' >
<li><p>At the start of each round of combat, you’ll decide your priorities and <a href='#aspects-and-approaches'>assign dice</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Then, you’ll <a href='#turn-order'>determine turn order</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><p>On your turn, you can:</p>
<ul>
<li>make an <a href='#attacking-and-defending'>attack</a>,</li>
<li>use one of your two <a href='#using-tactical-moves'>tactical moves</a>,</li>
<li>and <a href='#movement'>move</a> a number of spaces equal to your speed,</li>
<li>or you can choose to forgo an attack and either <a href='#other-actions-in-combat-time'>attempt another action</a> or <a href='#fleeing'>flee</a>. </li>

</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Certain tactical moves allow you to act at times outside your turn.</p>
</li>
<li><p>You roll defence whenever you are attacked.</p>
</li>
<li><p>When every combatant has had a turn, the round ends and a new round begins.</p>
</li>

</ol>
<blockquote><h2 id='battle-stance'>Battle stance</h2>
<p><strong>GM</strong>: The demon bears its teeth and howls at you, readying to attack. We’re entering combat time. Everyone pick an approach and roll tactics for turn order.</p>
<p><strong>Sam</strong> <em>(playing Sam Carter):</em> I want to get in there quick and trip it over. I’m taking a focused approach and putting 2d6 on tactics.</p>
<p><strong>Chelsea</strong> <em>(playing Diana Weathers):</em> I’m already low on Energy. I’m prioritising defence. I guess attack second, since my combat speciality is ‘brutal’? Ooh, and I want to slow the demon as well with my tactical move!</p>
<p><strong>Will</strong> <em>(playing Enoch Rutherford):</em> I’m going d8s all round, see how this goes. </p>
<p><strong>GM</strong>: Alright, roll tactics for me. Chelsea, roll twice and give me the lower result.</p>
<p><strong>Chelsea</strong>: That’s a 2.</p>
<p><strong>GM</strong>: Cool, the demon’s tactics is reduced by 2. What are you doing to slow it down?</p>
<p><strong>Chelsea</strong>: It growled at us, I’m… going to growl back!</p>
<p><strong>GM</strong>: That’s confusing enough to startle it into hesitating. Good idea. Okay, I’m going to count down, when I reach your tactics roll result, you can act. 15, 14, 13, 12, 11, 10—</p>
<p><strong>Sam</strong>: I got a 10! I’m going to debuff the demon with my tactical move. I want to flash my torch in its eyes to blind it, so it can’t attack as easily. I roll 2d6 for a result of 7, and I have the ‘strategic’ combat speciality, so that’s a 9.</p>
<p><strong>GM</strong>: That beats its defence score, so it’s now slowed and debuffed. Well done! And an attack?</p>
<p><strong>Sam</strong>: I’m going to get up close and attack with my radknife. I’ve only got a d6… oh, that’s a 6!</p>
<p><strong>GM</strong>: That meets its defence score, so you deal 3 damage from your blade. The demon roars in pain. You staying right up next to it?</p>
<p><strong>Sam</strong>: I’ve moved as much as I can, so I guess so. Here’s hoping that being blinded will save me!</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id='aspects-and-approaches'>Aspects and approaches</h2>
<p>In the <em>RADS</em> system, there are three <strong>aspects</strong> of combat:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Attack</em> represents your ability to hit and deal damage to another combatant.</li>
<li><em>Defence</em> is your ability to avoid taking damage.</li>
<li><em>Tactics</em> is your ability to act more quickly than other combatants and perform tactical moves. </li>

</ul>
<p> At the start of each round, each player chooses which aspect they will prioritise, and to what extent, by choosing one of three <strong>approaches</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>A <em>balanced</em> approach lets you assign 1d8 to each aspect.</li>
<li>A <em>tilted</em> approach lets you assign 1d10 to one aspect, 1d8 to a second aspect and 1d6 to the third aspect.</li>
<li>A <em>focused</em> approach lets you assign 2d6 to one aspect you wish to prioritise, and 1d6 to each of the remaining aspects.</li>

</ul>
<p>For example, a player might decide they want to be aggressive, but not at the expense of their safety, while they don’t mind acting later than others. In this case, they would use a tilted approach and assign 1d10 to attack, 1d8 to defence and 1d6 to tactics.</p>
<h2 id='turn-order'>Turn order</h2>
<p>Every combatant takes one turn per round. At the start of each round, players roll their tactics die for that round to determine the order in which they will act. The GM will count down from 15, with players acting when the result of their tactics roll is reached. Creatures controlled by the GM act on their tactics score.</p>
<h3 id='ties'>Ties</h3>
<p>Sometimes multiple combatants will have the same tactics roll result or tactics score as one another. Ties are resolved as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>In a tie between players, the players decide who acts first.</li>
<li>In a tie between your opponents, the GM decides who acts first.</li>
<li>In a tie between a player and a human opponent, such as an agent or a civilian, the player acts first.</li>
<li>In a tie between a player and a demon opponent, the demon acts first.</li>

</ul>
<h2 id='movement'>Movement</h2>
<p><em>RADS</em> is  designed to be played on a hexagonal battle mat and tokens to represent your character. On your turn, you can move your character around the battle mat up to 6 spaces. A space represents about 6 metres. Hexes are recommended over squares, because squares suck and hexes are great, but feel free to work with whatever you’ve got. You can spread out your movement between and around actions. </p>
<p>You can also play <em>RADS</em> using ‘Theatre of the Mind’ without tokens or a map, instead approximating distances and keeping a rough mental picture of the orientation and positioning of combatants in your head. If using Theatre of the Mind, each space equates to approximately 6 feet. </p>
<h2 id='attacking-and-defending'>Attacking and defending</h2>
<p>To attack, roll your attack die against an opponent’s defence score. If you meet or beat the score, you succeed. The target of your attack loses Energy equal to the difference between their defence score and the result of your roll, plus additional <strong>weapon damage</strong> depending on the implement you used.</p>
<p>When you are attacked by an opponent, roll your defence die against the opponent’s attack score. If you fail, you lose Energy equal to the difference between the result of your roll and their attack score, plus their weapon damage.</p>

<p>Every Rads’ primary weapon is their <strong>radknife</strong>, a short dagger made of a pale green, radioactive glass called <em>trinitite.</em> Trinitite was created in the nuclear blast of the first nuclear bomb detonation, the Trinity test, in 1945. It deals +3 weapon damage against a demon. Trinitite has never been successfully replicated, making it a highly rare resource. Against any opponent other than a demon, it acts like a small weapon, dealing +1 weapon damage.</p>
<p>Rather than an exhaustive list of items, <em>RADS</em> groups weapons together into four abstract categories:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Small weapons</strong> deal +1 weapon damage against non-demon targets. Lightweight and easily concealed, small weapons include knives, knuckle dusters and broken bottles. </li>
<li><strong>Large weapons</strong> deal +2 weapon damage against non-demon targets. Although they are more powerful, these weapons are hard to conceal or justify if seen by a bystander. A large weapon might be a golf club, a sword or a table leg.</li>
<li><strong>Guns</strong> deal +2 against non-demon targets and can be used at a distance, but will draw attention if fired in earshot of bystanders.</li>
<li><strong>Unarmed attacks</strong> and <strong>thrown weapons</strong>  deal no additional weapon damage. This means that if you exactly meet your target’s defence score with the roll, you hit but deal no damage. This still counts as a successful attack roll for the purpose of tactical moves. </li>

</ul>
<p>Regardless of how they fare against other targets, non-trinitite weapons have  -3 weapon damage against demons.</p>
<h2 id='using-tactical-moves'>Using tactical moves</h2>
<p>During character creation, you pick two <a href='#tactical-moves'>tactical moves</a> for your character. These are two fighting techniques that your character has practiced until they are like second nature, and can be performed with minimal additional effort during a combat situation. </p>
<p>Tactical moves use your tactical die and cost 1 Energy to use. Tactical moves specify at what point during a round they can be used; you can only use one a round. </p>
<h2 id='other-actions-in-combat-time'>Other actions in combat time</h2>
<p>Instead of attacking on your turn, you can attempt to do something else to affect the situation. This could simply be replicating the effect of another tactical move, or creating an advantage more specific to your situation.</p>
<p>Describe what you want to do to the GM, who will decide whether it is feasible to attempt this action within the timeframe of a single round of combat (5-10 seconds). If so, you can make an <a href='#attribute-rolls'>attribute roll</a> as you would during scenic time. You cannot benefit from a bonus from your <a href='#your-day-job'>day job</a>, and you always act alone.</p>
<p>Attempting something other than fighting exposes you to greater risk. On a round where you attempt to make an attribute roll, you cannot attack or use a tactical move, and your tactics and defence dice are both 1d6.</p>
<h3 id='fleeing'>Fleeing</h3>
<p>At any point, you can choose to flee combat. Your attack die becomes a <em>retreat die</em>, which you roll at the start of your turn, increasing the number of spaces you can move that turn by half the result (rounded up).</p>
<p>Civilians, opposing Rads and demons will usually also flee once they are sufficiently intimidated or injured.</p>
<h2 id='ending-combat-time'>Ending combat time</h2>
<p>Combat time ends when the outcome of a fight is settled and it is no longer necessary to track actions from moment to moment. This might be because one side has been killed, forced to surrender or routed.</p>
<p>Once the relentless pace of combat has ended, you will be able to regain some composure as long as you are not seriously injured. After you drop out of combat time, you gain 1d6 Energy if you have 0 or more Energy, up to your maximum (usually 24). Characters with negative Energy remain at their current Energy value.</p>
<p>Once the outcome of a conflict has been determined, the scene may well be over. However, if there are people to be healed, damages to be repaired or other loose ends to tie up, you can return to scenic time. If anyone has a negative Energy value at the end of combat time, you will always have a chance to save them from catastrophe.</p>
<h3 id='when-shouldnt-you-fight'>When shouldn’t you fight?</h3>
<p>Fighting is noisy and obvious, potentially drawing unwanted attention to the characters. Tricking, trapping or otherwise overcoming an opponent of any kind using nonviolent means are all valid options and will often be a more sensible approach than all-out violence. If you do find yourself in combat against an overwhelmingly superior foe, fleeing, surrendering or even allowing yourselves to be beaten into submission are all reasonable alternatives to fighting until you reach negative Energy or die.</p>
<h1 id='the-world-of-rads'>The world of <em>RADS</em></h1>
<p>To the vast majority of the world’s inhabitants, the monsters known as demons are almost entirely unknown, the easily dismissed and forgotten subjects of folk legend or and campfire tale. This is due to the concerted and ongoing efforts of government agencies to hide the horrifying reality of our world from the masses, for the public’s protection—and to avoid retribution for their own parts in the atrocities wrought by demonkind.</p>
<p>What follows are the true accounts of the discovery of the radioactive ‘demon’; of the process by which they are created; of the governmental organisations who researched, developed and capitalised on their existence for their own ends; and of the disparate do-gooders who work to thwart their efforts. </p>
<p><em>While the following is fictitious, it draws on real-life elements and takes influence from real activities conducted by the USA and USSR between the Second World War and the ‘present day’ of the game’s setting in 1979. The organisations and people referenced are real and many civilians were genuinely subject to dangerous experiments by government-backed scientists without their knowledge or consent.</em></p>
<h2 id='trinity'>Trinity</h2>
<p>The Trinity test marked humanity’s first stride into the Atomic Era. On the 16th day in July, 1945, the team from Los Alamos Laboratories detonated the first atomic bomb at White Sands Missile Range, deep in the barren desert of New Mexico. </p>
<p>When the blast went off, it took 40 seconds for the shock wave to reach the observers, 20 miles away from the impact site. In those moments, they saw the world lit up with hues of gold and purple, red and green, and finally a searing white. The mushroom cloud swelled 7.5 miles high. The air was hot as an oven when the wave hit. The ten men observing the event at Compania Hill—scientists, politicians, soldiers—cheered in jubilation.</p>
<p>The next day, one of the Los Alamos junior researchers sent to inspect the bomb site complained of headaches, dizziness and fatigue. He was prescribed aspirin and bed rest. He stayed in bed for two further days. What left the hospital room on July 19th was no longer a human being.</p>
<h2 id='demons'>Demons</h2>
<p>It was Robert J. Oppenheimer who first used the name ‘demon’ to describe what emerged from the wreckage of that man. Oppenheimer set up a team at <strong>Sandia National Laboratories</strong> to investigate the process, named the <strong>Y Process</strong> after the so-called Y Project team who had produced the first bomb at Los Alamos.</p>
<p>In the weeks that followed his transformation, the team concluded that the transformation had occurred because the subject had been bombarded with gamma radiation during his time at the test site. However, experiments exposing other human test subjects to comparable amounts of radiation failed to reproduce the effect.</p>
<p>When the bombs dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, the Sandia Labs team watched as closely as any of their colleagues, not simply to observe the awful power of the atom, but for further instances of the transformation. </p>
<p>In the devastation of Japan’s twin bombings, confused and contradictory accounts of demonic creatures wreaking havoc on their surroundings were reported, with one central theme: all of them took place around photography processing shops. Armed with this new information, the scientists at Sandia Labs narrowed down their investigations, eventually revealing the culprit.</p>
<p>Hydroquinone is a naturally occurring substance produced variously by select species of insect, shrub, fungi and mammal, most commonly used as a developing agent for black and white film. On that fateful day following the Trinity test, the doomed researcher had been selected to document the site because of his passion for and skill in photography. </p>
<p>The combination of gamma radiation and traces of concentrated hydroquinone in the body was the necessary cocktail for a person to become a demon. With this mystery solved, the scientists at Sandia Labs were now able to replicate the process and uncover the mysteries of the radioactive monsters.</p>
<h3 id='the-y-process'>The Y Process</h3>
<p>The Y Process comprises three progressive phases of transformation. In the first instance, subjects lose their inhibitions as though permanently drunk. Their existing characteristics are warped and exaggerated, with their latent unacceptable impulses coming to the fore and defining their behaviour. At Phase 1, changes will reverse if exposure to radiation ceases.</p>
<p>As the mutation progresses to a second phase, subjects become paranoid and hostile. Higher cognitive faculties swiftly diminish, with subjects first losing their self-control, followed by their ability to communicate complex ideas or speak full sentences. Biological changes become more pronounced, exceeding normal human capabilities in some areas while atrophying in others. Throughout Phase 2, the change is reversible if exposure ceases and the individual is treated by regular ingestion of a weak solution of sodium hydroxide (lye), which acts to neutralise the acidic hydroquinone, over the course of several days.</p>
<p>In the final phase, the creature is unrecognisable as a human and has become a demon. Demons show extreme variance in their physical appearance and each one may have unique physiological or paranormal capabilities, but they all possess inhuman strength and exhibit extremely violent tendencies. While they completely lose the power of speech, however, demons seem capable of strategic planning, if only to the extent that doing so advances their repugnant goals of violence. By Phase 3, all changes are irreversible. </p>
<p>Phase 3 also poses an additional threat: upon entering the final phase of the demonic transformation, a demon begins to emit the same kind of gamma radiation which initiated the Y Process transformation. Any human beings who are wounded by or even exposed to a Phase 3 demon for a sufficiently long time period will begin to undergo the Y Process themselves if they come into contact with hydroquinone. In other words, in Phase 3, demons begin to reproduce.</p>
<h2 id='rads'>Rads</h2>
<p>In 1947, Sandia Labs was taken over by the newly established <strong>Armed Forces Special Weapons Project</strong>. Based on the above findings about the nature of the Y Process, they pursued two avenues of research: transforming people into demons as a way of turning a citizen of an enemy state into a source of chaos, and controlling the mutated monsters to produce super soldiers with enhanced abilities. What they discovered was something altogether more incredible. </p>
<p>A relatively tiny fraction of people (estimated to be anywhere between 0.1% and 0.01% of the general population) do not respond to hydroquinone and gamma radiation with the Y Process. Instead, they experience a period of illness characterised by nausea, fever and delirium. Once the illness subsides these uncommon individuals, humanity intact, find themselves in possession of near-miraculous paranormal abilities.</p>
<p>These radioactively-empowered people were nicknamed <strong>Rads</strong> by the AFSWP team. Despite extensive research, to this day there are no known genetic or environmental signals which would identify a person as having the potential to gain such powers. It seemed that the only real way to find and activate a Rad would be to initiate the Y Process and hope for the best.</p>
<p>The first Rad discovered was subject to countless tests and experiments, ultimately dying in the process. The hunt was now on to create more Rads who could be recruited and trained up as secret agents in service of the United States government.</p>
<h3 id='agencies--agents'>Agencies &amp; Agents</h3>
<p>Meanwhile, the Soviet Union had been hard at work conducting parallel research into nuclear technology. Their own weapon test in 1949, First Lighting, had caused a similar mutant transformation to Trinity, and Russian scientists had latched onto the potential military applications quickly. It remains unknown when the first Soviet Rad came into existence, but by 1953, the US had gained conclusive evidence that a number of Rads were acting on behalf of the USSR, under command of the All-Soviet Scientific Research Institute of Experimental Physics, codenamed <strong>Volga Office</strong>.</p>
<p>In 1959, AFSWP became the <strong>Defence Atomic Support Agency</strong>. By this time, a select group of Rads had been successfully activated and brought onboard as covert operatives, dispatched on international espionage missions as well as being deployed on US soil to fight demonic threats at home.</p>
<p>Not every Rad who was activated under AFSWP/DASA was successfully onboarded as an Agent. Some, activated during large-scale civilian tests, were overlooked in the catchment process; others were deemed unsuited to military or covert work and were discharged. Still more Rads were created as a side-effect of demonic activity, or as a result of Soviet attacks on American soil. For various reasons, by the mid 1960s, there were an increasing number of unaligned Rads within the general population.</p>
<h3 id='the-free-rads'>The Free Rads</h3>
<p>Some time in the mid-1960s, a senior Agent working for DASA began to notice a strange trend. Given the extremely low prevalence of Rads among the general population, an unusually high proportion of demonic attacks resulted in the activation of new Rads. Conducting some discreet experiments, she came to a simple conclusion. For some reason, demons were especially drawn to attack people who had the potential to gain Powers through gamma exposure.</p>
<p>Rather than take this information to her superiors, the Agent continued to conduct her own investigation, this time turning her attention to DASA itself. Before long, her growing suspicion was proven horribly correct: not all of the demon attacks on US soil were the result of Volga Office attempting to spark chaos and fear in US citizens. In fact, many of the monsters she’d been sent to dispatch had been intentionally created and let loose by DASA in order to hunt out potential recruits.</p>
<p>In response to her discovery, the nameless Agent in question used her security clearance and network of contacts to track down as many ex-Agent or civilian Rads as she could, bringing them together to form a new organisation. The <strong>Free Rads</strong> were founded in 1967, with the mission to use their powers to protect civilians from demons and government agencies alike, and fight demons wherever they appeared. </p>
<p>The Free Rads based its organisational structure closely off other dissident groups of the time, imitating the semi-independent cell structure used by the US Communist Party and the Mattachine Society. Most cells knew nothing concrete about the wider organisation and would rely on a single anonymous contact to give them information and orders.</p>
<h2 id='dna'>DNA</h2>
<p>In 1971, DASA became the <strong>Defense Nuclear Agency</strong>. DASA’s Agents were all retired from active duty, with many deemed to be potential security risks ‘disappeared’ by their superiors. The message put out among those in the know was that demon-based warfare had been outlawed at the highest levels and research into the Y Process abandoned, but the Free Rads’ leadership remained rightfully sceptical. Up to this point, the Free Rads had maintained informants within DASA, but with the forcible ousting of all but a select few loyalists from DNA, their lines of intelligence had been broken.</p>
<p>In subsequent years, demon attacks on US soil continued. Through some means never disclosed to the wider organisation, the Free Rads acquired the ability to identify many of these attacks at very short notice, sometimes even pre-empting them entirely—but while this led to a substantial improvement in their ability to mitigate the damage, this was offset by a worrying trend that emerged towards the latter half of the 1970s. </p>
<p>More and more demons had been observed exhibiting signs of intelligence and strategic thought, with some even retaining some humanlike features while still boasting the strength of a full Phase 3. The origins of these <strong>Phase 2.5</strong> demons was unknown, with theories pointing fingers at DNA, Volga Office, or even a more fundamental shift in the planet’s background radiation levels, but the wider implications were obvious: the fight against demonkind was only going to get worse.</p>

<li><strong>1946</strong> The other factor in the Y Process, exposure to hydroquinone, is discovered and the three phases of demon transition are codified. The first Rad is activated.</li>
<li><strong>1947</strong> Armed Forces Special Weapons Project is formed out of Sandia National Labs. AFSWP begins testing the Y Process on US citizens. The same year, the USSR establishes the All-Russian Scientific Research Institute of Experimental Physics (VNIIEF), codenamed Volga Office.

<li><strong>1952</strong> Volga Office begins utilising Rads as secret agents for covert operations in US and allied territories. </li>
<li><strong>1959</strong> AFSWP is replaced by Defense Atomic Support Agency. Focus shifts to creating Rads and using them as secret agents, both to fight demonic incidents on US soil, and as covert operatives for foreign espionage.</li>
<li><strong>1967</strong> The Free Rads are formed.</li>
<li><strong>1971</strong> DASA becomes the Defense Nuclear Agency. Work on Rads is supposedly terminated.</li>
<li><strong>1976</strong> The first ‘Phase 2.5’ demons are observed, exhibiting the limited intelligence and self-control of a Phase 2 but with almost all the strength and viciousness of a completely transformed Phase 3.</li>

</ul>
<h2 id='1979'>1979</h2>
<p>The 1950s were characterised by unprecedented economic growth and technological advancement, and the &#39;60s followed with sweeping liberalisation and progressive social change. The space race was won, and it felt like we could do anything. Then the 1970s happened.</p>
<p>The world&#39;s major economic powers, the USA and the USSR, are in a protracted Cold War over ideological and economic differences. While an official détente has been in place since 1969, the whole planet continues to live live under the threat of nuclear holocaust and paranoia about spies, sabotage and subterfuge is commonplace.</p>
<p>Over half the world&#39;s population live under repressive dictatorships, the remnants of colonialism and the victims of globalisation. Frequent and costly proxy wars are fought in Asia, Africa, Latin America and Eastern Europe. The Vietnam War is one of many unpopular conflicts driven more by the political and economic interests of an elite few than the safety of the American people. </p>
<p>Economic &#39;stagflation&#39; and successive oil and energy crises have left engagement and trust in government and social institutions lower than they have been in decades, with labour strikes routinely paralyzing infrastructure. Decades of post-war consensus between major political parties is coming to an end as the Republicans withdraw support for socially progressive welfare reforms in favour of new-fangled neoliberal economics.</p>
<p>The widespread social changes in the &#39;60s led to increased rights for women and minorities, but a conservative backlash is underway. The civil rights movement in the USA and international second-wave feminist movement have both begun to fracture as increasingly diverse viewpoints and directions lead to infighting—and even violence. Traditional community structures are sliding out of relevance with little to replace them and culture is focusing more on individuality expressed through consumerism. Society is increasingly atomised, self-interested, selfish.</p>
<p>In short, the world looks like a bit of a shitshow. Nobody trusts anybody, everything seems to be falling apart… and demon attacks are on the rise again. Maybe the government doesn’t know, maybe they don’t care, or maybe they’re the ones behind it. It’s up to the Free Rads to find out, and protect the world from a very hostile takeover.</p>
