    <h1 id='character-creation'>Character Creation</h1>
    <p>Creating a Free Rad is quick, simple and can even be done at random, to explore characters you wouldn’t otherwise play.</p>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Determine <a href='#your-attributes'>your attributes</a>.</strong>
        Assign 2d6, 2d8, 2d8 and 2d10 among <em>might</em>, <em>agility</em>, <em>will</em> and <em>wits</em>. You can assign them according to your preference, use the process described below, or roll 1d4 twice to assign your highest and lowest attributes at random, re-rolling duplicates.
      </li>
      <li><strong>Choose a <a href='#your-day-job'>day job</a>.</strong>
        Select from <em>law enforcement, driver, bureaucrat, medic, tradesman, performer, criminal, journalist,</em> or roll 1d8 to assign at random. Note the <em>talents</em> you gain.
      </li>
      <li><strong>Choose your <a href='#your-powers'>Powers</a>.</strong>
        Select a gift from <em>warding, illusion, wildspeech, compulsion</em> and <em>divination</em>, or roll 1d6 to assign at random, re-rolling on a 6. Note the Powers you gain.
      </li>
      <li><strong>Choose a <a href='#your-combat-speciality'>combat speciality</a></strong>.
        Select from <em>brutal, tough, alert, strategic, speedy</em> and <em>unconventional</em>, or roll 1d6 to assign at random.
      </li>
      <li><strong>Choose two <a href='#tactical-moves'>tactical moves</a>.</strong>
        Select from <em>advance, delay, aid, sabotage, quicken, slow, flurry, savage, counter</em> and <em>protect</em>, or roll 2d10 to assign at random, re-rolling duplicates.
      </li>
      <li><strong>Write them up</strong>
        Put your character’s details into a character sheet, along with their starting Energy (24), movement (6 spaces, unless you have the ‘speedy’ combat speciality) and name (up to you!).
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>The resulting character will look a bit like this:</p>

    <h3 id='what-makes-a-good-rads-character'>What makes a good <em>RADS</em> character?</h3>
    <p>Free Rads come from diverse cultural and socioeconomic backgrounds. Feel free to create a rich other life for your character, bearing in mind the following:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Physically, being a Free Rad means your character is a competent and capable investigator who is willing and able to fight when necessary. </li>
      <li>Personality-wise, your character can be, want, feel, say and do whatever you like, as long as this does not conflict with working alongside the other Free Rads to complete your missions.</li>
      <li>In terms of relationships, you and your fellow players’ characters are part of the same cell of the Free Rads, and should know one another at least professionally and be committed to working together.</li>
      <li>Morally, no matter their background, all Free Rads share a drive to protect the innocent, minimise damage, suppress awareness of demons’ existence and banish them from the world for good.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3 id='are-there-any-characters-you-cant-play'>Are there any characters you can&#39;t play?</h3>
    <p>As well as being a game, an RPG is an engine for cooperative storytelling. <em>RADS</em> is designed to tell a certain kind of story, and pushing to tell a different kind of story during a game could undermine the enjoyment of everyone else at the table. The above passage describes the kinds of characters who suit the stories which <em>RADS</em> is designed to tell. Some character concepts just don’t fit into this mould.</p>
    <p>Pacifists or weaklings who can&#39;t or won&#39;t engage in a physical fight; lone wolves or loose cannons who don’t play by the rules or work with others; or contrarians and conspiracists who think that civilians aren’t worth protecting, that demons shouldn’t be kept hidden, that “the government is right” or that “the Free Rads are the true demons”; stories about these characters might be exciting, nuanced and well worth exploring, but they’re probably best explored elsewhere.</p>
    <p>With all that having been said, this is a book. It has no power to stop you from playing those characters if you want. Just discuss it with your GM and the rest of the table first, and caveat ludio.<br></p>
    
    <br>
    <h2 id='your-attributes'>Your attributes</h2>
    <p>Characters in <em>RADS</em> have four attributes: <strong>might</strong>, <strong>agility</strong>, <strong>will</strong> and <strong>wits</strong>. When you attempt something that uses an attribute, you’ll roll two dice and add the results together. The size of the dice rolled is determined by how capable your character is with each attribute.</p>
    <p>You can assign 2d10 to one attribute, making this your character’s strength, 2d8 to two attributes at which you’re moderately competent, and 2d6 to the attribute your character is worst at. You can assign these values however you like or do so at random, but if you’re struggling, or want to create a character who fits into a more archetypal role, use the following process:</p>
    <p>Your attributes begin at 2d6 and can increase to 2d8 or 2d10 depending on your choices. To determine your attributes, you must answer two questions. </p>
    <ol>
      <li>Firstly, is your character more proficient with their body, or their mind?</li>
      <ol>
        <li>If body, increase the size of your might and agility dice.</li>
        <li>If mind, increase the size of your will and wits dice. </li>
      </ol>
      <li>Secondly, does your character prefer to use force, or finesse?</li>
      <ol>
        <li>If force, increase the size of your might and will dice.</li>
        <li>If finesse, increase the size of your agility and wits dice. </li>
      </ol>
    </ol>
    <p>This method of calculating attributes means that a player character’s highest attribute determines their lowest attribute as well: a mighty character is always less witty, while a wilful character is always less agile.</p>
    <h2 id='your-day-job'>Your day job</h2>
    <p>Between missions, a Free Rad lives a normal life and works a fairly normal job. In the course of a mission, your character can use the skills and demeanour they’ve developed in their everyday existence, as well as using their day job as a cover to conceal their true purposes to other people they interact with.</p>
    <p>Your <strong>day job</strong> grants you the following benefits:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>You have two <strong>talents</strong>, which allow to automatically succeed at certain tasks that would be incredibly difficult or impossible to anyone untrained in your field, no roll required. </li>
      <li>When you’re attempting an action that would be easier for someone with the experience and skills in your day job, you get a +1 bonus to the <strong>attribute roll</strong>.</li>
      <li>While interacting with people, you get a +2 bonus to any attribute rolls relating to covering up your true motives and other relevant social interactions, as long as you’re behaving normally for someone with your day job. This is called a <strong>cover bonus</strong>.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>When you create a Free Rad, you can choose from the following covers and flesh out the exact details of what your character does, choosing from the example jobs given or coming up with your own. You gain the associated talents, which don’t require a roll. </p>

    <h3 id='breaking-cover'>Breaking cover</h3>
    <p>If you fail a roll while benefiting from a cover bonus, or if you’re caught acting in a manner that obviously deviates from normal behaviour for your day job, any person who is observing you at the time will become suspicious. You no longer benefit from your cover bonus when interacting with this person, and depending on their disposition and what you’ve been doing, they may actively work to thwart your efforts. Failing an attribute roll that benefits from a +1 bonus from your day job doesn’t raise suspicion in this way.</p>
    <h2 id='your-powers'>Your Powers</h2>
    <p>All Free Rads have <strong>Powers</strong>, gained after their exposure to gamma radiation. All Powers bend reality, and each gift is useful to a Free Rad in a different way, with its own unique rules and restrictions on its use. Unless otherwise specified, Powers can affect civilians, Rads and demons alike.</p>
    <h3 id='illusion'>Illusion</h3>
    <p>An <em>illusion</em> twists the senses, casting doubt and sowing confusion. An illusion affects the mind of a select group of creatures, making a target disappear for them, making them see a target differently, or making them see a target that doesn’t truly exist. The target can be an object or a creature.</p>
    <p>Characters with the gift of illusion are called <em>illusionists</em>; they gain the following illusion Powers:</p>

          </tr>
        </tbody>
      </table>
    </figure>
    <h4 id='the-rules-of-illusion'>The rules of Illusion</h4>
    <p>Illusions have no physical presence and are purely visual manifestations, having no affect on sound, smell, nor do they affect temperature or airflow in a space. To create an illusion, you must be touching the target of the illusion or the target space where the illusion will appear. They can be of any size.</p>
    <p>When you attempt to use an illusion Power, choose which creatures you wish to be affected. You can choose specific individuals who you wish to affect, or specify some group, for example “the next three people to walk past this doorway”, and you can exclude creatures as well, for example your fellow Free Rads.</p>
    <p>The cost of an illusion Power is twice the number of affected creatures.</p>
    <p>While you are using an illusion Power, the target is faintly lit up with shifting colours and patterns. </p>
    <p>An illusion placed on a static object, or a static illusion on a fixed location, lasts for 1 hour. Moving illusions last for 5 minutes. When you create an illusion, you can choose to double the length of the illusion; doing so causes you to lose 1 additional Energy. You can do this multiple times, doubling the length each time, up to a maximum of length of 24 hours.</p>
    <p>If the target of your illusion is an unwilling creature and they are aware that an illusion has been placed on them, they may attempt to resist it once using Agility. If they fail, they cannot attempt this again.</p>
    <p>If any creature affected by an illusion is presented with evidence that the effect they perceive is fake, they can attempt to resist it. If they succeed, they no longer see the effect. If they fail, they do not suspect the truth and continue to believe that the effect is real until the illusion is out of sight or ends. Illusions affect creatures independently; one creature could overcome an illusion and cease to perceive the effect while another continues to be affected by it.</p>
    <h3 id='wildspeech'>Wildspeech</h3>
    <p>Wildspeech is the ability to communicate with animals. Both greater and lesser than language, it allows for a mutual respect and understanding beyond words, but not the translation of complex concepts.</p>
    <p>Rads with the gift of wildspeech are called <em>wildspeakers</em>; they gain the following wildspeech Powers:</p>
    <figure>
      <table>

            <td style='text-align:center;' >Roam</td>
            <td>Designate a location within a minute’s travel for the animal. The target will travel to the location; as it does so, your own senses are suppressed and you perceive what the target perceives.</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td style='text-align:center;' >Urge</td>
            <td>Describe a single action the target can complete within a minute. The target will perform the task, provided doing so will not put it in immediate danger.</td>

          <tr>
            <td style='text-align:center;' >Recall</td>
            <td>Ask the target 3 questions about events in the last 48 hours, within a distance of your current location that the target can travel in a minute.</td>
          </tr>
        </tbody>
      </table>
    </figure>
    <h4 id='the-rules-of-wildspeech'>The rules of wildspeech</h4>
    <p>When you attempt to use a wildspeech Power, you draw an animal to you from the surrounding area (within a minute’s travel for the animal), choosing to call either a beast of the sky, the land or the water to be the target of the miracle. You will always have to provide an offering of food to the animal.</p>
    <p>The cost of using a wildspeech Power is determined by how far you are from true wilderness. In complete wilderness, the cost is 2. If you can see a human-made structure, the cost is 4. If you are stood on human-made ground, the cost is 6. If you cannot see the sky because of a human-made covering, the cost is 8.</p>
    <p>While you are using a wildspeech Power, your eyes glow faintly green, the air around you moves with a gentle breeze, and a faint smell of fresh pine permeates the vicinity. </p>
    <p>Wildspeech temporarily imbues animals with a sense of trust, respect and cooperation toward the wildspeaker, but not improved mental or physical abilities. Wildspeech cannot cause an animal to fight or risk its own life. </p>
    <p>Animals cannot attempt to resist the effects of wildspeech.</p>
    <h3 id='compulsion'>Compulsion</h3>
    <p>Compulsion warps the minds of living things, putting them at the mercy of another’s will. Where illusion touches the senses, intercepting the message between eye and brain, compulsion magic can affect personality, if only for a while. Compulsions affect beliefs, actions and intentions.</p>
    <p>Rads with the gift of compulsion are called <em>mesmerists</em>; they gain the following compulsion Powers:</p>
    <figure>

          <tr>
            <td style='text-align:center;' >Incite</td>

        </tbody>
      </table>
    </figure>
    <h4 id='the-rules-of-compulsion'>The rules of compulsion</h4>
    <p>The cost of using a compulsion Power is the target’s will score.</p>
    <p>While you are using a compulsion Power, the target is unaware of anything unusual happening. Anyone else present hears an unnatural resonance to your voice and sees your hands moving gently past the target’s face in hypnotic patterns.</p>
    <p>At the moment you finish using a compulsion Power, you utter a single sentence which changes the target’s mind. A compulsion can make a target believe, feel or do almost anything, save injure themselves or their loved ones, but a target compelled to act against their nature becomes pale, glassy-eyed, clumsy, dim-witted and slow. The further the target  strays from their nature, the more obvious the effects.</p>
    <p>A target remains under the effect of the compulsion for 1 hour. When a compulsion would end, you can choose to extend the duration of the compulsion by another hour if you and the target can see one another. Doing so causes you to lose 2 Energy for each hour the compulsion has already lasted, up to a maximum length of 24 hours. If a compulsion ends naturally, the target remembers nothing unless encouraged to recall and given ample insight into what happened.</p>
    <p>A target cannot freely attempt to resist a compulsion. However, a target submerged in running water automatically resists the compulsion. If a target successfully ends the compulsion in this way, they remember everything.</p>
    <h3 id='warding'>Warding</h3>
    <p>Warding divides the world into inside and outside, reinforcing material barriers and creating powerful spaces. Wards are invisible magical barriers at the perimeter of a clearly defined target space. Wards separate outside from inside and affect civilians, demons and Rads who enter, occupy or leave the space.</p>
    <p>Blades with the gift of warding are called <em>wardens</em>; they gain the following warding Powers:</p>

    <h4 id='the-rules-of-warding'>The rules of warding</h4>
    <p>You can ward any single target space, regardless of size, as long as its perimeter is clearly defined by solid barriers such as walls and a ceiling. The space must be one single area within; a room is an acceptable target, a building with multiple rooms within is not. A gap in the perimeter larger than 2 metres in any dimension makes a space impossible to ward. To ward a space, you must be touching its perimeter.</p>
    <p>When you use a warding Power, the cost is equal to the number of openings in the perimeter of the target space through which a human being could comfortably pass with ease. Include unlocked doors, windows or passageways out of a room.</p>
    <p>While you are creating a ward, the target space feels physically warm and emits a faint glow. Once created, alarm and sanctify wards are imperceptible; repel wards will be apparent to anyone affected.</p>
    <p>A ward persists for 24 hours. A space cannot be warded with multiple wards.</p>
    <p>A creature who is affected by a ward automatically attempts to resist it when they enter a warded space for the first time. If they succeed, the ward ceases to affect them permanently, but continues to exist for other creatures. Whether they fail or succeed, they won’t be aware that the ward exists if it is a sanctify or alarm ward. Wards affect creatures independently; one creature could overcome a ward, while another still feels its effects.</p>

    <p>To use a divination Power, you need a reflective surface, such as a mirror or a pool of still water, which you gaze into as you contemplate the subject of your divination. </p>
    <p>The cost of using a divination Power is set by fate: roll a d8 to determine the cost. </p>
    <p>While you are using a divination Power, the air around you grows cold and the reflective surface into which you gaze appears darkened to all others. Other creatures who look at it for more than a few seconds experience a piercing headache. </p>
