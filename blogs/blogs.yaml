                        I read all mail without exception, and love getting it, but can no
                        longer reply to everything. You can reach me at:
                        ludicity.hackernews@gmail.com.


                        I will prioritize responding, in order, if:

                        <ol>

                        <li>You live in Melbourne and want coffee. I have accepted 100% of
                        these requests so far.</li>

                        <li>You want to invite me onto a podcast or something because the
                        flames of my ego are a roaring inferno that needs constant
                        feeding, to the dismay of all those around me.</li>

                        <li>You want to be connected to another reader in your local
                        area.</li>

                        <li>You're an engineer that shares my values that needs some help,
                        particularly students and members of marginalized
                        communities.</li>

                        </ol>


                        My podcast, "Does A Frog Have Scorpion Nature" which is just me
                        chatting with readers and friends. Available on all major
                        platforms.


                        Mastodon because it's so much nicer than Twitter.


                        Liberapay | Patreon to support me writing taking time off to write
                        amidst the difficulty of launching a business.


                        If you're working at a startup that is needs to conform to the
                        analytics requirements of an enterprise sale, you can hire me and
                        my team at Hermit Tech. We'll give you good advice, never lie,
                        write quality code, and refuse to use the phrase "AI" on pain of
                        me being personally branded a hypocrite-incompetent on the
                        internet forever.
