Because the internet is a library, not a shopping centre.

## Publications

-   [Astral Codex Ten](https://astralcodexten.substack.com) is about reasoning, science, psychiatry, medicine, ethics, genetics, AI, economics and politics.
-   [The Intrinsic Perspective](https://www.theintrinsicperspective.com/) is about science, culture and humanity.
-   [Stay Grounded](https://www.staygrounded.online) is a good starting point for reframing and taking control of your relationship to the internet, especially news and social media.
-   [Garbage Day](https://www.garbageday.email/) is a deep dive into shallow culture, like being on Twitter without having to be on Twitter.
-   [Internal exile](https://robhorning.substack.com/) is a Marxist take on culture, capitalism and AI. 

## Software

-   [Typora](https://typora.io) is a markdown editor. I use it every day for everything I write. It exports pretty seamlessly to .html, .doc and .pdf with the help of [Pandoc](https://pandoc.org/). \$14.99 for a lifetime license on up to 3 devices.
-   All my websites are made in [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and hosted on [Neocities](neocities.org/).
-   For graphic design, I use the fantastic [Affinity Suite by Serif](https://affinity.serif.com/en-gb/). It’s a one-time payment for Publisher, Photo and Illustrator software that rivals Adobe.
-   Audio editing is done with the help of [Audacity](https://www.audacityteam.org/).
-   I try to read as much as possible on Kindle, for a more streamlined, reading-focused experience. [KTool](ktool.io/) is the best tool for sending things to Kindle I have ever encountered and I’m happy to pay for it.
-   For everything I don’t read on Kindle (primarily webcomics), I use RSS feeds collated in [Inoreader](inoreader.com/) — available as an app and in browser.
