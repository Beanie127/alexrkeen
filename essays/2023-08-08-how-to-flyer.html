			<h1>How to flyer at Edinburgh Fringe</h1>
			<p>
				Flyering is a tried-and-tested method for raising awareness of
				your show to attract audiences. On the surface, it sounds pretty
				simple, too: give out bits of paper with your show info on, how
				hard could that be? Yet flyering can be physically and mentally
				challenging and many, many people do it in a way which
				undermines their chances of successfully generating awareness of
				their show.
			</p>
			<p>
				As someone who works in Marketing and User Experience Design, I
				hate seeing enthusiastic and talented performers get ground down
				by flyering because of simple mistakes. In this essay, I break
				down each step of flyering in detail to explain how to do it
				better, before sharing some tips and tricks to be mindful of
				while developing your paper promo strategy.
			</p>
			<p>
				By the end, inexperienced flyerers will learn to promote their
				shows more effectively, avoid some of the more basic traps they
				can fall into and hopefully look after themselves better while
				on the Royal Mile.
			</p>
			<p>
				Before we dive into technique: this essay is for
				<strong
					>novice flyerers whose primary goal is to promote their show
					as best as possible.</strong
				>
				If you&apos;re in a performing arts school production and
				you&apos;re mostly in Edinburgh to have a good time, feel free
				to do all the inefficient stuff I complain about later on if it
				brings you joy. Conversely, if you&apos;re a veteran and you
				disagree with me, tell me! Write your own article or drop me an
				email and I&apos;ll incorporate your feedback.
			</p>
			<p>
				The easiest approach to flyering (and the focus of this essay)
				is working in a public space with lots of passers-by. More
				confident marketers can also approach static groups or tables
				for more detailed conversations. I strongly recommend building
				up to this by doing the simpler kind of flyering first,
				primarily because the direct approach technique is less
				efficient unless you have a very high quality rate for your
				interactions.
			</p>
			<h2>Step 1: Position yourself where your audience go</h2>
			<p>
				Work out when and where your audience will be, go to a spot
				where they are able and willing to receive your flyer, and stay
				there.
			</p>
			<h3>Be where your audience is</h3>
			<p>
				If you&apos;re a dark, intriguing drama, you&apos;re targeting a
				very different crowd than a loud, in-your-face stand-up comic or
				a youth theatre group doing a creative retelling of Shakespeare.
				Think about your ideal audience member. How do they spend a day
				at the Fringe? What time do they get up? What other shows are
				they seeing? Where do they hang out in between shows?
			</p>
			<h3>Find a sweet spot</h3>
			<p>
				If people are in a rush (or have people behind them who are in a
				rush), they do not want a flyer. Do not create a bottleneck for
				people who need to be somewhere else — this generates ill will.
				Conversely, if people have room to roam around, most people will
				tend to avoid people handing out flyers. Explore your
				surroundings and find a location where the micro-geography
				funnels people towards you, so they don&apos;t just wander away,
				but where they&apos;re not hurried along.
			</p>
			<p>
				Other flyerers will move around as you work; if an area gains
				too many people flyering, passers-by will tend to avoid the
				cluster. Likewise, try not to be too close to street performers.
				Performing in the street is a tremendous skill and they deserve
				their space. Besides, they probably draw a different crowd than
				you&apos;re looking for and being near them will change the flow
				of pedestrian traffic. Even if there&apos;s audience overlap,
				it&apos;ll be distracting and throw you off your game.
			</p>
			<h3>Stay put</h3>
			<p>
				Once you&apos;ve found a good space, root yourself there for a
				bit. Moving around is inefficient — travelling alongside people
				takes time and can read as threatening, while going past people
				minimises your interaction time and usually causes you to miss
				the person behind them. Picking one location where people flow
				past you is easier and means your attention can be focused on
				pitching. Rather than trying to flyer every person who passes
				your spot, pick a direction and try to flyer the people who are
				coming from that direction.
			</p>
			<h2>Step 2: Pitch your show to people going past</h2>
			<p>
				When you see someone you can flyer, make eye contact, hold out a
				flyer and pitch them your show.
			</p>
			<h3>Who can you flyer?</h3>
			<p>
				Do not flyer people who are running, have no free hands or are
				talking on the phone. Do flyer people who are in casual
				conversation, people who pull away from you and especially
				<em>people who you think look grumpy</em>. When you are nervous,
				you will interpret neutral expressions as scary — and some
				people just have scary faces! — but actually, most people are
				okay with being flyered, even if they aren&apos;t interested in
				your show specifically. It&apos;s incredibly unlikely that
				someone will strongly object to being flyered, and if someone
				does abuse you for doing it, they are the one behaving
				unacceptably.
			</p>
			<h3>Make eye contact</h3>
			<p>
				We are social creatures and people form emotional attachments
				with people. Even if you&apos;re exit-flyering another show
				handing out flyer after flyer by the second, try to make a
				connection with each one. Eye contact is incredibly powerful for
				this. If someone completely dodges your gaze, they probably
				don&apos;t want to be flyered; if they do, they&apos;re open to
				hearing you out.
			</p>
			<p>
				When something unexpected intrudes into one&apos;s field of
				awareness, it takes a second to parse what&apos;s happening and
				decide whether that intrusion is welcome or unwelcome. If you
				flyer people who are already walking past you, the act will feel
				more intrusive, less expected, because of how it interacts with
				their personal space, and by the time they understand
				what&apos;s happening, they have probably gone past. Minimise
				the amount you intrude by flyering people early, as they&apos;re
				walking towards you.
			</p>
			<h3>Hold out your flyer</h3>
			<p>
				In most instances you have seconds to get people to take a flyer
				from you. Don&apos;t make it difficult for them: hold it out
				away from your body where it is visible and grabbable. I&apos;ve
				seen physical theatre shows doing dances in the street, waving
				flyers about so vigorously that an interested person is more
				likely to come away with a black eye than a flyer in their hand
				— make your flyer accessible!
			</p>
			<h3>Pitch your show</h3>
			<p>
				What is your show about? Why should someone want to see it? What
				differentiates your show from any other show that people could
				see? Depending on the pace of walking traffic and how much
				interest someone expresses, you need to be able to convey this
				in five sentences, and in three sentences, and in one sentence,
				and in three words.
			</p>
			<p>
				<strong
					>One of the most common mistakes I see performers make in
					flyering is confusing attention for interest</strong
				>. It is easy to get people&apos;s attention: set off a firework
				in the middle of a crowded street, and people will be paying
				attention to you. Interest is much harder to create. Most people
				will not be interested in your show; the first thing your pitch
				needs to do is tell the kind of person who might like the kind
				of thing you&apos;re advertising that this is their kind of
				show. In other words, what is your unique selling point?
			</p>
			<blockquote>
				<p>Audience = Visibility &times; Appeal &times; Sentiment.</p>
			</blockquote>
			<p>
				For some shows, the selling point is easy: if you&apos;re in a
				queer cabaret, putting &lsquo;queer&rsquo; front and centre in
				your marketing and your pitch is a very clear way of
				communicating to other queer people that your show is for them!
				If in doubt, your pitch should start with the <em>genre</em> and
				<em>medium</em> of your show. Is it comedy, drama, true life? Is
				it sketch, standup, physical theatre, a play, mime, a capella?
				Most people have certain genres and artistic mediums they are
				drawn to and others they would rather die than sit through.
			</p>
			<p>
				For
				<a href="https://matesimprov.com"
					><em>MATES: The Improvised &rsquo;90s Sitcom</em></a
				>, “The improv sitcom! Award-winning comedy show!” is my go-to.
				If I have a little time, I add “could we BE any funnier?” from
				our flyer copy, which gets a laugh almost every time. If people
				stop to ask for more, I get out the venue and time and then
				mention that we were Theatre Weekly&apos;s Best Improv Show at
				Ed Fringe 2022. Our show is an unusual combo of two genres;
				putting those first helps grab people who like one or both of
				those things, then &lsquo;award-winning&apos; conveys quality.
			</p>
			<h2>Step 3: Repeat as many times as is feasible</h2>
			<p>
				Once you&apos;ve gotten in position and given your first flyer
				out, you&apos;re done! Pat yourself on the back, pack up and go
				for a pint. If you like. But if you want your flyering to be
				effective, you probably have to do a lot of it.
			</p>
			<h3>The magic formula</h3>
			<p>
				The number of people who see your show is equal to the number of
				people who know about your show, multiplied by the percentage of
				people who might be interested in your show, multiplied by the
				percentage of people who have a positive emotional response to
				your marketing. In other words, Audience = Visibility &times;
				Appeal &times; Sentiment. Flyering affects both visibility and
				sentiment and you want to maximise both — high quantity means
				nothing if every person who sees your flyer is turned off by the
				way you handed it to them.
			</p>
			<p>
				Repetition affords you the opportunity to develop your
				technique. Experiment with your pitch — not just the words, but
				your tone of voice, how much oomph you put into each person,
				etc. If you fluff something, if it doesn&apos;t go well, no
				matter! The next person you can try it out on is just a few
				second away.
			</p>
			<p>
				Obviously, a successful attempt at flyering someone is one that
				results in them taking your flyer. But unsuccessful attempts
				still exist on a spectrum. Did you make someone smile? Did you
				make them laugh? Or did you make them avoid you? Try to get
				better at making the experience of being flyered by you a
				positive one, and over time your hit rate and your show
				experience will benefit.
			</p>
			<h3>Don&apos;t overdo it</h3>
			<p>
				If you&apos;re working alone, pace yourself. Flyering for hours
				and hours every day might deliver you an audience, but if it
				uses up all your energy or crushes your spirit, was it worth it?
				If you&apos;re in a cast, agree a reasonable amount of time to
				spend flyering and then stick to it. Nothing breeds resentment
				faster than one person dropping the ball when it comes to
				promoting the show and letting everyone else pick up the slack.
			</p>
			<h2>Tips and tricks</h2>
			<h3>Experiment until you find what works</h3>
			<p>
				Edinburgh Fringe is (or used to be) the place you came with Work
				In Progress shows, because there&apos;s no better time to
				workshop new material and experiment with your style and
				technique than when you have a show every day. Take the same
				approach to flyering. Play around with pitches, locations, vocal
				tones. Maybe you work best having fewer, higher-quality
				interactions walking around outdoor seating and engaging people
				who are sat drinking? Maybe you could flyer near a venue with a
				similar show?
			</p>
			<p>
				The tiniest changes can make a big difference: I saw an uptick
				in the number of positive responses when I switched from saying
				“Improv sitcom — the award-winning comedy show” to “The improv
				sitcom — award-winning comedy show” — not something I&apos;d
				have thought of planning the pitch in advance, but a valuable
				discovery. On day one of the Fringe, I started with
				“Award-winning comedy show — the improv sitcom!” — same words in
				a different order — and got a way worse reception. Why? Leading
				with a promise of quality means nothing if you don&apos;t care
				about the thing you&apos;re hearing about, and people are
				bombarded with promises of five-star, sell-out, award-winning
				shows — I needed to differentiate us from the crowd first.
			</p>
			<p>
				Keep an eye out for patterns. You might observe, for instance,
				that people moving in one direction are interested in flyers,
				while others aren&apos;t. In that case, face that direction for
				a bit! Develop and then test your theories. Doing so might
				improve your results, or it might not, but keeping things fresh
				for your own benefit will also help you to keep going as the
				festival goes on.
			</p>
			<h3>Your pitch is not a question</h3>
			<p>
				A lot of people tend to offer their flyer as if they&apos;re
				asking a question: “Sketch show tonight? Free stand-up?”. I can
				see why this happens: it feels politer, less intrusive somehow.
				It also makes you sound uncertain about the thing you&apos;re
				presenting. Think of a market stall trader hawking their wares —
				you never hear “Punnet of strawberries, two for a pound?” belted
				out with a rising inflection at the end of the sentence.
				Realising this several years ago was a revelation for me and
				since consciously rephrasing my pitches as statements, I&apos;ve
				seen a massive increase in my success rate flyering. If
				there&apos;s one thing you take away from this essay, try this.
			</p>
			<h3>Don&apos;t tread on other performers&apos; toes</h3>
			<p>
				I&apos;ve been in the middle of conversations with people about
				my show and had random people barge in and try to sell their own
				show instead. This is abhorrent behaviour and will win you no
				favours. Slagging off other shows, no matter how light-hearted
				your tone or how receptive your audience is, is similarly gross
				and will absolutely turn off punters.
			</p>
			<p>
				Exit flyering another show whose audience overlaps with yours
				can be incredibly effective (provided their show is good). Many
				shows will be happy to allow it and may want to do the same
				after your show in turn. However, some will have other shows of
				their own to promote, and others might have venues with strict
				rules about what can and cannot be promoted while onsite. Ask
				permission and respect the answer.
			</p>
			<p>
				Don&apos;t go around someone else&apos;s venue putting your
				flyers on their chairs without asking. Don&apos;t put stickers
				over print that cost someone else hundreds or even thousands of
				pounds. The performing arts lives and breathes networking and if
				you gain a reputation as the kind of person who would screw over
				someone else to try and get ahead, you will quickly find it
				coming back to bite you in lost opportunities and goodwill.
			</p>
			<h3>Advertise your show, not the Fringe</h3>
			<p>
				Walking around Bristo Square or along the Royal Mile, you see a
				lot of people doing weird stuff to try and flyer people. From
				ostentatious displays like walking around in costume acting
				creepy or chanting in the street, to more passive approaches
				like lying down on the floor with your head covered and holding
				up flyers in the air, these seem like they get a lot of
				attention, but minimal genuine interest.
			</p>
			<p>
				I would love to hear from someone who does this and finds it an
				effective way to flyer. More often than not, this approach to
				flyering does a great job of advertising the vibe of Edinburgh
				Fringe, but unless you&apos;re very good at spontaneous street
				performance, it doesn&apos;t benefit (or can even damage) public
				perception of the quality of your show. As I said above,
				performing in public is challenging and those who do it well
				have years of practice.
			</p>
			<p>
				Even if you are great and it&apos;s very relevant to what your
				show is about, performances which involve your whole cast are
				also very inefficient — if ten of your cast are reciting lines
				from your show out loud to passers-by, that&apos;s ten people
				who could instead be covering the town in flyers to maximise
				visibility.
			</p>
			<p>
				Likewise, avoid flyering messages which centre around the fact
				that you&apos;re flyering. Offering people “free bit of paper”
				or saying “take my last flyer please” might get a cheap laugh
				and even a flyer in a hand, but it&apos;s a very low-quality
				interaction. It might work for fresh-faced tourists excited for
				The Fringe Experience, but it&apos;s not a sustainable way to
				generate a relevant and engaged audience — and experienced
				Fringegoers will find it more irritating than charming.
			</p>
			<h3>Take rejection gracefully</h3>
			<p>
				People are mostly going to turn you down when you offer them a
				flyer. When it happens, take the hint. They might have all sorts
				of reasons for not wanting to come and see your show, or they
				might be the perfect person for your show, caught at the wrong
				moment — you&apos;ll never know, but they don&apos;t owe you a
				reason.
			</p>
			<p>
				If you are extremely charismatic, you might be able to get away
				with pressuring people once in a blue moon, but you&apos;re far
				more likely going to make someone hate you and never come to the
				thing you&apos;re asking them to engage with. The social
				contract at a Fringe Festival allows you to offer something
				once; take no for an answer.
			</p>
			<h3>Don&apos;t <em>not</em> flyer other flyerers…</h3>
			<p>
				…but don&apos;t get in their way when they&apos;re trying to
				work. A significant proportion of audiences in Edinburgh are
				made up of other people doing their own shows, and getting seen
				by other artists is good for your reputation — they&apos;re more
				likely to talk about you on social media and their opinions are
				more likely in turn to get amplified by the community and the
				algorithm. However, be respectful of their time and mindful that
				they&apos;re also here to promote a show. Don&apos;t engage
				someone in conversation for twenty minutes unless they seem
				genuinely interested in making a new friend.
			</p>
			<h3>Keep your spirits up</h3>
			<p>
				Flyering can easily get dispiriting if you&apos;re not getting a
				positive response. As your enthusiasm drains, varying your
				situation is a great way to refresh your mood. Change direction
				or move to a new spot; switch up your pitch; even just switching
				which hand you hold your flyers in can help.
			</p>
			<p>
				If you&apos;re feeling tense, take notice of your body. Are you
				frowning? Are your shoulders raised? Are your arms stiff? Take a
				brief breather, force yourself to relax those muscles.
			</p>
			<p>
				When things go wrong, you can get trapped inside your head. Take
				a breather and turn your attention to the world around you.
				Check out a street performer; watch someone else flyering and
				see how they do it; enjoy the sights of this beautiful city. If
				you can&apos;t help but dwell on a mistake, remember that each
				person you interact with is coming at your situation completely
				fresh — they don&apos;t know you haven&apos;t been having a good
				day, or that you just stumbled over your words.
			</p>
			<p>
				Finally, if nothing else works, take a proper break. Give
				yourself fifteen minutes to leave the area, sit down, get a
				drink. Staying well-fed and hydrated is also super important
				throughout your Fringe experience, but especially while flyering
				— it&apos;s hard work!
			</p>
			<h2>Conclusion</h2>
			<p>
				Many people find flyering boring, tiring and intimidating; while
				learning to flyer more effectively helps with this a little,
				ultimately it&apos;s always means to an end. Treating it as a
				practice that I can improve, taking pride in my achievements and
				enjoyment in the process, isn&apos;t just useful for getting
				bigger audiences — it also helps me stay motivated and enjoy my
				Fringe more. And in the end, what&apos;s the point if we&apos;re
				not having a good time?
